This example is based on the "terrain3" example of the terrain plugin, 
with two modifications: 
the fractal terrain is replaced with a precomputed one, with a precomputed
texture as well, and a road graph is used, via layers, to modify the
terrain shape and texture procedurally (based on the paper "Real-time 
rendering and editing of vector-based terrains", Eric Bruneton and
Fabrice Neyret, Eurographics 2008).

\subsection sec-graph1-terrain Precomputed terrain

The replacement of the fractal terrain with a precomputed one is done
as in the "terrain4" example (see \ref sec-terrain4-res), and is not 
detailled here. The replacement of the procedural texture with a 
precomputed one is also very similar: we first define an ortho
CPU producer to load the tiles from disk to main memory (in a tile
cache on CPU):

\dontinclude graph1/helloworld.xml
\skip groundOrthoCpu
\until groundOrthoCpu1

We can then reference this CPU producer from the OrthoGPUProducer:

\skip "groundOrthoGpu1"
\until "groundOrthoGpu1"

\subsection sec-graph1-layers Graph based elevation and texture layers

In order to define layers based on vector data we first need a graph
producer, which will produce graph tiles by clipping and flattening
a root graph. We also need a tile cache to store the produced graph
tiles on CPU. This is done as follows:

\dontinclude graph1/helloworld.xml
\skip graphCache
\until file="roads"

This defines a cache that can store up to 2048 graph tiles, and a
graph producer using this cache, and using as root graph the 
"roads.graph" file. The graph factory specifies which kind of graph
implementation we want (lazy or not, hydro graph or not, etc).

Adding a layer using this graph to the ortho GPU producer, in order
to draw roads on the terrain, is then very easy:

\skip <orthoGpuProducer
\until </orthoGpuProducer 

We simply need to declare a proland::RoadOrthoLayer layer as a 
sub-element of the producer declaration, with a reference to the
previous graph producer, and to the shader that will effectively
draw the roads in the texture (see below). Note that we also
need to add a "backgroundCache" attribute in the ortho GPU producer
itself. This is necessary when layers are used with a precomputed
texture (this cache may be different from the "cache" one).

Adding a layer using the above graph producer to the elevation
producer, in order to deform the terrain where there are roads, is
a little more complex. Indeed the proland::RoadElevationLayer needs
a producer, on CPU, that can compute the raw terrain elevations, as
the elevation producer does on GPU (it needs it to compute road 
elevation profiles). This is the role of the 
proland::CPUElevationProducer, which is declared as follows:

\dontinclude graph1/helloworld.xml
\skip groundElevationsCPU
\until residuals="groundResiduals1"

Note that we only need one channel per pixel, and that the tile
size must be the same as the one used by the GPU elevation producer.
We can then declare a proland::RoadElevationLayer in the elevation
producer on GPU:

\skip <elevationProducer
\until </elevationProducer

Here we specify two producers for this layer, the one producing the
graph, "roads", and the one producing the raw elevations on CPU, 
"groundElevations2". We also specify the shader that will actually
modify the terrain elevations, "roadLayerElevationShader" (see below).
Finally the "level" attribute specifies that this layer must not 
be used for quadtree levels less than 2.

The "roadLayerOrthoShader.glsl" shader is used to draw triangle strips
covering roads, with a uv parameteriztion along the strips. The vertex
shader simply scales and translates the input vertices with the given
"tileOffset". The fragment shader computes a color and an alpha mask,
which will then be blended into the raw terrain texture. In this
implementation this shader computes roads stripes procedurally, but
you can easily change this (as an exercise: try to add an "asphalt"
texture to roads - hint: look at the "texturedPlastic.xml" and
"texturedPlastic.glsl" files in the Ork examples). Note that you
can change this shader will the program is running, to immediately
see the effects of your changes on the appearance of roads.

The "roadLayerElevationShader.glsl" is similar. In addition to the
vertex coordinates it also takes as parameter, in the "uv" vertex 
attribute, the vertex elevation and its distance to the road axis 
(relatively to the road width). It must output the
road elevation in the blue channel, an alpha value, and a fragment
depth (to ensure that crossing roads blend nicely). The current
implementation is very basic but you can easily change it, including
while the program is running (to immediately see the effects of your
changes on the appearance of roads).

The output road elevations and alpha coefficients are then blended
into the raw terrain elevations with the "blendShader.glsl" shader
(you can specify another name with the "blendProg" attribute in the
elevation producer resource).
