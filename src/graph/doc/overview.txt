\section sec-intro Introduction

The Proland graph plugin provides some producers dedicated to the
production of vector data, and to the rasterization of vector data
into raster tiles. <i>This plugin depends on the terrain plugin</i>.

\subsection sec-graph Graph producer

A <b>graph</b> contains 2D vector data made of points, curves, and
areas. Vector data can be used to represent linear terrain features
such as roads and rivers, as well as areal features such as foret
areas, city areas, etc. It can be used to draw these features on top
of an orthophoto, to modify terrain elevations in order to correctly
insert these features into the terrain, to drive the procedural
generation of objects on top of the terrain (such as planting trees
along roads), etc. The main advantage of vector data is that it is
resolution independant, unlike raster data. Hence you can get very
precise linear features at all scales with very few data.

In Proland, Graphs are mainly used in
\link proland::GraphLayer GraphLayers\endlink, which can draw
data on any producer based on the content of a graph. See Ortho
\ref sec-orthogpulayers or Elevations \ref sec-elevationlayers.

More precisely a graph is made of <i>nodes</i>, <i>curves</i> and
<i>areas</i>:

- a node is simply a 2D point.
- a curve joins a start node to an end node through some vertices.
- an area is a set of curves that form a loop oriented in 
counter-clockwise order. An area can contain recursively another graph,
called a subgraph.

A graph is called that way because it stores the connectivity
between these elements. A node stores the set of curves that are
connected to it (in the above example, both N1 and N2 have
references to C1, C2 and C3). A curve has references to the two
nodes at its extremities, as well as references to the areas that
contain this curve (at most two, one on each side of the curve - for
instance C2 has references to A1 and A2, while C3 only has a
reference to A1). Finally an area is simply a list of curve
references, together with their orientations.

A node is only defined by two (x,y) coordinates. A curve is defined
by its start and end node and by its vertices. It also has a type
and a width, which can be interpreted as you want, depending on your
needs. The vertices can be <i>regular</i> or <i>control</i>
vertices. A curve made only of regular vertices gives a polyline
(this is the case of C2 in the above example). But you can also
insert one or two (at most) control vertices between two regular
vertices, which then define a smooth quadratic or cubic Bezier patch
between these two regular vertices (for instance C3 in the above
example is made of a quadratic and a cubic Bezier patch). Note that
regular vertices are on the curve, while control vertices are not
(they define tangent vectors at the regular vertices). The polyline
joining the vertices (the dashed line in the above example) is
called the control curve of the curve.

A graph can be <b>edited</b> in arbitrary ways by adding and
removing nodes, vertices, curves or areas, moving nodes or vertices,
etc.

A graph can also be <b>clipped</b> to a specified rectangular area
by removing the graph elements that fall outside this clipping area.
Here the "elements" are the linear, quadratic or cubic Bezier
patches of the curves. This means that a curve can be clipped only
at the regular vertices between these patches (i.e., we do not
compute the exact intersections of a curve with the clip area, to
improve performance). A clipped curve can result in several
disconnected smaller curves. One the contrary a clipped area result
in at most one area (by construction). In order to get closed areas
we sometime need to introduce new straight line curves to close
clipped areas:

\htmlonly
<center>
<embed src="graph-clip.svg" width="80%" type="image/svg+xml"/><br/>
<div class="caption">Once clipped, the closed curve forming a loop
on the left gives new nodes (N2 and N3) and two clipped curves (in
blue and green on the right). Note that the curve is not clipped at
the exact intersections with the clipping area, but only at regular
vertices. In order to close the clipped area a new straight line
curve is added between N2 and N3. In practice the clipping is done
in two steps, first by an horizontal slab, then by a vertical one,
in order to avoid problems at corners when closing clipped areas
with straight lines.</div>
</center>
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html graph-clip.svg
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

In order to take curve widths into account during clipping, the clip
area can be automatically enlarged with a <b>margin</b> to avoid
clipping curves whose axis is outside the clip region, but not their
borders:

\htmlonly
<center>
<embed src="graph-margin.svg" width="80%" type="image/svg+xml"/>
<br/>
<div class="caption">Margins avoid clipping curves whose axis is
outside the clip region, but not their borders. Without margins
(left) the curve is discarded, which is incorrect. With a margin
equal to half the curve width, the curve is not discarded
(right).</div>
</center>
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html graph-margin.svg
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

Finally a graph can also be <b>flattened</b> by introducing new
vertices in curves so that their control curve converge toward the
smooth curves themselves. This is used to draw the control polylines
instead of the curves themselves, which is simpler. The result is
the same if the control polylines are close enough to the smooth
curves. The new vertices are computed by using the recursive Bezier
curve subdivision algorithm, until the maximal distance between the
curve and its control curve is less than a specified threshold:

\htmlonly
<center>
<embed src="graph-flatten.svg" width="80%" type="image/svg+xml"/>
<br/>
<div class="caption">A graph is flattened by replacing the curve
vertices with new vertices computed from the old ones, and so on
recursively, until the distance between the control curve (dash
line) and the real curve (plain line) is below some specified
threshold.</div>
</center>
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html graph-flatten.svg
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

During this process we compute a <b>pseudo curvilinear
coordinate</b>, noted <i>s</i>, for each vertex along curves.
Initially this pseudo coordinate is the vertex index in the curve.
During flattening, fractional coordinates are computed for the new
vertices with the same formulas as for the vertices themselves.
These pseudo coordinates allow us to quickly find the <b>real
curvilinear coordinate</b> along a curve (noted <i>l</i>), only when
needed and even if it is not flattened enough (with the help of an
auxilliary curve "fully" flattened, and by using a dichotomic
search):

<div class="caption">The pseudo curvilinear coordinate s is used to
quickly compute the real curvilinear coordinate l. Note that s has
nothing to do with the real length along the curve.</div>
</center>
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html graph-curvilinear.svg
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

When a graph is modified by <i>editing</i>, <i>clipping</i> or 
<i>flattening</i> the changes made to the graph are notified to the
<b>listeners</b> of this graph. These changes are described as a set of
removed curves and areas, and a set of newly added curves and areas.
In other words a modified curve, for instance, is described as the
removal of an old curve and the addition of a new one. These changes
can be exploited by incremental versions of the clipping and
flattening operations. The <b>incremental clipping</b> operation
takes as input a source graph, the same graph clipped to some
region, and some changes made to the source graph. It produces as
output an updated clipped graph and the changes made to this clipped
graph. It does this without clipping again the whole source graph.
Instead it uses the source changes to recompute only the changed
elements in the clipped graph. The <b>incremental flattening</b>
operation works in a similar manner.

A <b>graph producer</b> is a producer that produces graph tiles for
each quad of a quadtree. The produced graph for each quad contains
only the vector data that intersect this quad (taking margins into
account), flattened with the appropriate threshold so that the
curves can be drawn in associated raster tiles with good precision.
The graph for the root quad is "produced" by simply loading a graph
from disk. The graph for any other quad is produced by 
<i>clipping</i> the graph of the parent quad, and by <i>flattening</i>
the result with half the threshold used for the parent graph.

\note It is also possible to precompute and store on disk the
clipped graphs for a given quadtree level L. In this case no graph
will be produced for levels between 0 and L-1. Graphs at level L are
then "produced" by loading them from disk. Graphs at level more than
L are produced by clipping and flattening from their parent graph,
as before. This option can be useful for very large graphs.

\note We say that the graph of the parent quad is the <b>parent
graph</b> of the four clipped graphs of the child quads. A graph has
a reference to its parent graph, if there is one (i.e. if this graph
was produced by clipping from another graph). Likewise a curve has a
reference to its <b>parent curve</b>, if it was produced by clipping
from another curve, and an area has a reference to its <b>parent
area</b>, if it was produced by clipping from another area. The 
<b>ancestor</b> of a graph, curve or area is the parent of the parent of
... the parent of the element, which has no parent itself.

A graph producer is a listener of its root graph. It is then
notified of any change made to this root graph, for instance via the
graphical user interface provided by the
proland::EditGraphOrthoLayer (see \ref sec-orthogpulayers
"Predefined Ortho GPU producer layers"). When changes are detected
the graphs for the quads other than the root are recomputed
incrementally, from top to bottom, by using the incremental clip and
flatten operations. This recursive descent stops when the new
changes returned by these operations become empty. See below for
more details.

\subsubsection sec-graphclasses Graph classes

The concepts above are implemented by the classes in the
\ref graph module. A graph is an instance of
proland::Graph. This class defines all the functions that can
be performed on graphs, such as loading and saving them to disk,
accessing their nodes, curves and areas, moving, adding and removing
nodes, curves and areas, clipping and flattening graphs incrementally
or not, etc. It also manages the graph listeners, notifying them of
any change. This class can be used anywhere you need to manipulate
graphs, <i>except</i> when you need to instantiate a graph. Indeed
this class is abstract. You can only instantiate one of its two
concrete subclasses, proland::BasicGraph and
proland::LazyGraph. The first one keeps the whole graph in
memory at all times, until the graph is deleted. The second one loads
the graph elements from disk only when needed (i.e., <i>lazily</i>),
and deletes them from memory when they are no longer used. It can be
used for very large graphs that exceed the CPU memory capacity.

The proland::Node class represents a node. It stores the (x,y)
coordinates of the node, the references to the curves connected to
this node, and a reference to the graph to which it belongs, called
its <i>owner</i>.

The proland::Curve class represents a curve. It stores
references to the start and end nodes of the curve (and their pseudo
and real curvilinear coordinates s and l), the vertices of the curve
(with x,y,s and l coordinates for each vertex, plus a boolean to
distinguish regular and control vertices), the curve type and width,
the references to the areas on each side of the curve (if any), a
reference to the parent curve (if any), and a reference to the owner
graph.

Finally the proland::Area represents an area. It stores the
references to the curves that form this area with, for each curve,
its orientation (a boolean indicating if the curve must be followed
from its start node to the end node, or the reverse - these oriented
curves must form a closed loop in counter-clockwise order). It also
stores a reference to the parent area (if any), and a reference to
the owner graph.

A proland::BasicGraph uses smart pointers to reference its
nodes, curves and areas. Hence these elements cannot be deleted until
the graph object itself is deleted, even if the nodes, curves and
areas are no longer referenced themselves (other than by the graph -
recall that smart pointers can be seen as "strong pointers",
preventing the target from being deleted before the source;
conversely normal pointers can be seen as "weak pointers", where the
target can be deleted at any moment). The curves and areas also use
smart pointers, to reference their parent elements. However, since
smart pointers must not form loops, the nodes, curves and areas use
normal pointers to reference their owner graph:

\htmlonly
<center>
<embed src="basicgraph.svg" width="60%" type="image/svg+xml"/><br/>
<div class="caption">A BasicGraph uses smart pointers to reference
its elements, which themselves use normal back pointers (to avoid
circular references).</div>
</center>
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html basicgraph.svg
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

A proland::LazyGraph uses normal pointers to reference its
elements. However these normal pointers are only used internally.
Externally, smart pointers are used. As a consequence, when an
element returned to a "client" becomes no longer referenced by any
smart pointer, this element is deleted (by the
ork::Object::doRelease method). In fact it is not, because this
doRelease method is overriden in the proland::LazyNode,
proland::LazyCurve and proland::LazyArea subclasses of
the above classes. This overriden method puts these unreferenced
elements in a cache (whose size is specified by the user in
proland::LazyGraph). If these elements are needed again a few
seconds later, they will be reused from the cache instead of being
reconstructed. Hence the cache prevents elements from being deleted
and recreated permanently.

\htmlonly
<center>
<embed src="lazygraph.svg" width="64%" type="image/svg+xml"/><br/>
<div class="caption">Internally, a LazyGraph uses normal pointers to
reference its elements. Externally it uses smart pointers. Hence
elements can be deleted when then are no longer referenced.</div>
</center>
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html lazygraph.svg
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

In fact each reference in a proland::LazyGraph is made of an
identifier and a normal pointer. The identifier indicates, via an
index map stored in the graph file, where the identified element is
stored on disk. The pointer is NULL if the referenced element has not
been loaded yet in memory, or if it is no longer in memory. In this
case, if the element is requested, the identifier is used to load it
from disk and to create its memory representation. These identifiers
can also be used by clients to designate graph elements when they
only need to identify them, without using them. In order to unify
identifiers for basic and lazy graphs (for basic graphs an
"identifier" is simply a pointer to the identified element), the
proland::NodeId, proland::CurveId, and
proland::AreaId types are unions that can contain either an
integer or a pointer.

\note A lazy graph handles added, modified and deleted elements in a
special way, in order to avoid reloading an outdated version of these
elements from the disk. Indeed a lazy graph references added and
modified elements with smart pointers, so that they cannot be deleted
before the graph itself. Deleted elements are removed from the index
map used to load elements from their identifiers, and so cannot be
reloaded from disk inadvertently.

The listeners of a graph are added and removed with the
proland::Graph::addListener and
proland::Graph::removeListener method. Each listemer must
implement the proland::GraphListener abstract class which
contains a single method. When changes occur in the graph, they are
stored in the proland::Graph::changes field, of type
proland::Graph::Changes, and then the listeners are notified.
Note that the previous value of the \link proland::Graph::changes changes\endlink 
field is lost. Hence
listeners must be careful to read its value before it is overriden
due to new changes. The number of changes that occured to a graph is
stored in the proland::Graph::version field. This integer is
initially 0, and is incremented after each change, before the
listeners are notified.

The margins used to clip a graph are specified with a
proland::Margin object. The role of this class is to compute
the margin to be used for each node, curve or area during clipping
(each element can use a different margin). It is also possible to
specify an additional margin computed from the clip area itself. This
can be used to account for tile borders (see \ref sec-
producerframework "Producer framework"). This class is abstract, i.e.
you must override it to define how margins must be computed,
depending on how you want to you the graphs.

Graphs can be easily extended, in order to represent special kind
of data (by adding specific parameters for Node/Curve/Area for example).
Almost all Graph methods are virtual to enable this. The user-defined
graph will need to re-implement the newNode/newCurve/newArea methods
to create the proper Node/Curve/Area's extensions, as well as the
createChild method to be sure that the new child Graph will be correct.
The load and save functions should also be overriden in order to
properly load the file.

The user can then change the behavior of graph for almost everything
he wants.

\note In order to be reusable even for basic graphs, the graphs have
a parameter count for each kind of parameter (number of curve
parameters, node parameters...) that are written in their '.graph'
file, and which are checked when loading the file:
For example, let's say you have a Graph with a float value added
in Curves. That value would just be ignored in BasicGraph and LazyGraph.
\endnode


\subsubsection sec-graphfiles Graph files

Graphs can be stored on disk in four formats: basic ASCII, indexed
ASCII, basic binary, indexed binary. The first byte of the file
indicates the file format: 0 means basic binary, 1 means indexed
binary, 48 (i.e., the <i>char</i> '0') means basic ASCII, and 49
(i.e., the <i>char</i> '1') means indexed ASCII. The ASCII formats
are easy to edit manually. The indexed formats contain a precomputed
index map indicating the offset of each element in the file. They are
faster to load than non indexed formats (non indexed files must be
fully read in order to construct the index map at runtime).

The next 7 parameters are used to determine if the graph in the file is
compatible with the Graph in which we want to load it.
Those parameters are:
<ul>
<li>Number of Node parameters: default is 2 (X, Y).</li>
<li>Number of Curve parameters: default is 3 (Size, Width and Type).</li>
<li>Number of Area parameters: default is 3 (Size, Info and subgraph boolean).</li>
<li>Number of Curve Extremities parameters: default is 1 (Node number).</li>
<li>Number of Curve Vertices parameters: default is 3 (X, Y, isControl).</li>
<li>Number of Area's Curves parameters: default is 2 (Curve number, orientation).</li>
<li>Number of Area's subgraphs parameters: default is 0.</li>
</ul>

After those data information bytes, non-indexed files must have the following
format:
- number of nodes (integer).
- description of each node.
- number of curves (integer).
- description of each curve.
- number of areas (integer).
- description of each area.
- description of each subgraph.

Indexed files must have the following format:
- offset of the index map in the file (long integer).
- description of each node.
- description of each curve.
- description of each area.
- index map.

A node description has the following format:
- x coordinate (float).
- y coordinate (float).
- number of curves connected to this node (integer).
- for each connected curve:
  - identifier of the curve (integer).

A curve description has the following format:
- number of vertices (including the start and end nodes - integer).
- width (float).
- type (integer).
- identifier of the start node (integer).
- for each vertex of the curve:
  - x coordinate (float).
  - y coordinate (float).
  - isControl (boolean).
- identifier of the end node (integer).
- identifier of the "left" area (integer, -1 if none).
- identifier of the "right" area (integer, -1 if none).
- identifier of the ancestor curve in the root graph file - must be
an indexed file (integer, -1 if none).

An area description has the following format:
- number of curves in this area (integer).
- user data (integer).
- a boolean set to true if the area has a subgraph (integer).
- for each curve of the area:
  - identifier ot the curve (integer).
  - orientation of the curve in the area (integer).
  - identifier of the ancestor area in the root graph file - must be
  an indexed file (integer, -1 if none).

A subgraph description has the same format has a non-indexed file
(minus the first byte indicating the format). Subgraphs are always
loaded with basic graphs, even if the graph itself is loaded with a
lazy graph.

The index map in indexed files must have the following format:
- number of nodes (integer).
- number of curves (integer).
- number of areas (integer).
- number of subgraphs (integer).
- for each node, the offset of its description in the file (long
integer).
- for each curve, the offset of its description in the file (long
integer).
- for each area, the offset of its description in the file (long
integer).
- for each subgraph, the offset of its description in the file (long
integer).

The identifier of a node is simply its index in the list of nodes, in
the order in which they appear in the file. Likewise for curves,
areas and subgraphs.

Here is an example of non-indexed ASCII file (the comments are <i>
not</i> part of the file):

\subsubsection sec-graphedition Graph Edition

Graphs are designed to be editable. For that purpose, the
proland::Graph class provides every function necessary to update
their content, and to maintain the stability of the system, independently
from the Graph type (They might have to be redefined if the Graph is
extended and if you add special links between Nodes/Curves/Areas).

Each time you add/remove a node or a curve, the Graph must be changed to
maintain a consistency (i.e. if a curve clips an area, it makes two areas,
and if a curve from an area is deleted, that area should be deleted too,
but if the curve had two areas, they must be rebuilt).

To avoid taking too much time by browsing the entire Graph, the add and
remove methods are smart and browse only the linked curves and areas to
detect what must be done. It checks if there are loops where you
added/removed a curve, and rebuild only those areas. Since there are
LOTS of special cases, this behavior is mandatory. It is the same when
you remove a Node, it can either delete the curves around it, or merge
them. If they are merged, they must be properly rebuilt and added to
their area(s).

Furthermore, for each editing function, Graphs are able to determine
what has changed and to return it in a proland::Graph#Changes
structure. If there are several changes in a row, they can be merged
in order to not delete twice the same curve for example, or to avoid
adding a curve and removing it right after. Those Changes structure
are very usefull to  determine what should or shouldn't be updated
in child graphs, especially for the proland::GraphProducer class.

<div class="caption">When adding a curve, the system checks if the curve

also able to determine that addings as (3) won't affect the areas, except
for refreshing the curves when adding the node itself. The same check 
operations must be performed when deleting a curve. Deleting Curve (1) 
will only delete one area, but deleting Curve (2) will merge the two areas 
around it. Finally, deleting curve 3 won't affect any curves, since it 
shouldn't be part of any curve (it isn't part of a loop, and therefore 
should be excluded from the area building process).</div>

\subsubsection sec-graphproducer GraphProducer class

The proland::GraphProducer class is a producer that can load a
precomputed Graph from the disk, and then subdivise it into subgraphs
corresponding to each Tile displayed.
It behaves as follow :

For the root Tile, the producer simply loads the Graph from a file (See
Load and save description and the \ref sec-graphfiles section). For every
other tile, if not already stored in cache, the corresponding Graph is clipped from
its parent Graph.



Since GraphProducers are also GraphListeners, they are able to determine when 
a Graph changed. When this happens, the GraphProducer invalidates its root Tile. 
The root graph won't be recomputed, but will contain the changes of its last 
modifications, and since every Graph depends on its parent Graph, the level 1 
Graphs will have to be checked and updated if necessary. If there were any 
changes in the operation, the sub-graphs of the level 1 Graph will be invalidated, 
and the same process will happen to them. Graphs are only updated when they are 
needed,  i.e. when the program calls the 
\link  proland::GraphProducer#getTile GraphProducer#getTile\endlink 
method. 

This is where the smart-update mechanism starts:
When computing a Graph for a given tile, the GraphProducer is able to determine 
if the Graph was already in cache and invalidated. If its the case, then, 
it needs to be checked. Otherwise, the graph will just be clipped (if not in cache) 
or simply not updated (if in cache and still valid).

Each Graph contains a version number, which enables the GraphProducer to determine 
which Graphs are up-to-date and which are not. If the version of a Graph is the 
same as its parent, then it is already up-to-date, and won't need to be updated. 
If its children are up-to-date with it, they won't need an update either. If the 
child's version is just the previous one of it's parent's version, we can apply 
a clip update on the current tile. Otherwise, if the versions are too different,
the Graph will have to be fully clipped again. When updated, each graph generates 
a list of changes, used in the incremental update mechanism. This also helps to 
determine if any modifications occured in the current Tile, and thus to determine 
if its sub-tiles should be updated.


The list of changes created by a Graph when it is updated contains the added and 
removed curves and areas. This allows to only update those curves and areas during 
clipUpdate. This is incremental, i.e. each time a Graph is updated, it checks its 
parent's last list of changes and version, updates its own curves and areas (the 
child curves and child areas of those from the list of changes, if any are found 
in the current Graph), and its own list of changes. If no elements were updated, 
then only the Graph version is updated, and the GraphProducer won't invalidate 
the child tiles. Otherwise, children will be invalidated, and they will at their 
turn use the previously computed version and list of changes.



The user can decide whether or not the parent tiles of currently used
tiles should be stored or not (Accelerates switching between levels,
but uses more memory).

the version is different from the parent one, tiles are recomputed; left Tiles 
are fully recomputed, while right tiles are only updated. The updated graphs 
will all contain the changed data. Those who were fully recomputed don't need 
to contain that data, because their children will be fully clipped too. The 
change list indicated on the lower left tile is the one it would contain if 
it had been only updated. The upper right tile doesn't have any changes because 
it doesn't contain the changed part in its graph : Curve C1 is actually clipped 
in smaller curves in the child tiles Only those corresponding to the changed part 
are updated. Also note that a moved or edited curve (on curve C1, only the 
status of the point changed) will have to be in the removed curves list, but 
also in the added curves list, so it will be removed and re-added in the child 
graph. </div>

A few options are then available :
- Precomputed Graphs : The user can specify one or more precomputed levels, for
which he can provide the corresponding Graphs. These Graphs must be stored
in a sub-directory in the directory of the root Graph with the same name.
Files should be named as follows :
[graph_name]_[level]_[XCoord]_[YCoord].graph.
Example : roads_03_00_00.graph would be the lower left Tile at level 3.
If one or more of the files doesn't exist, the Producer will create them
from the root Graph (when they are needed). Note that if the doFlatten
option is set to true, these subgraphs will have to be flattened.
Then, when needed, the proland::GraphProducer will load these files
instead of clipping them from the root Graph. This options allows to avoid
useless computations of undisplayed levels for example, and greatly
improves loading speed.

- \link proland::Margin Margins\endlink : Each class that will
use the producer may need additional data from the neighbouring tiles
(For example, to display a road that would go along a tile border, and
would be cut if not taken into account).
So, when created, these classes will have to add their margin into the
GraphProducer via the
\link proland::GraphProducer#addMargin() Margin()\endlink and
\link proland::GraphProducer#removeMargin() removeMargin()\endlink
methods. The largest will then be used.

- \link proland::GraphListener GraphListeners\endlink : Since they
use Graphs to generate other Graphs, GraphProducers must know when a Graph
was edited. In that purpose, GraphProducer implements the
proland::GraphListener#graphChanged() method : It invalidates the
first tile, which will cause the changes to be propagated through child
Graphs via the smart update mechanism : only required tiles will be
updated (as described above). This method is called each time the Graph
is edited.

- \link proland::CurveData CurveDatas\endlink : GraphProducers
also keep a cache of \link proland::CurveData CurveData\endlink
objects. CurveData class contains informations about a given Curve, such
as its length, type etc... For example, this is used in layers, to
compute height, length, stripes... A Size can be assigned to that
cache to avoid memory overloading.

\subsubsection sec-graphproducerresource Graph Producer resource

A proland::GraphProducer can be loaded with the Ork resource
framework, using the following format (the "graph1" example
illustrates how a GraphProducer can be used):

\verbatim
<graphProducer name="myGraphProducer" cache="graphCache"
file="myGraphFile"
    loadSubgraphs="true" doFlatten="true" precomputedLevel="3" precomputedLevels="3,1:5"
    nodeCacheSize="0" curveCacheSize="100000" areaCacheSize="100000"
    dataCacheSize="-1" storeParents="true"/>
\endverbatim

The graphs are produced in the tile cache resource specified by the
<tt>cache</tt> attribute. This cache must have an associated 
\link proland::ObjectTileStorage ObjectTileStorage\endlink. The
root graph is loaded from the <i>file</i>.graph file, where 
<i>file</i> is the value of the <tt>file</tt> parameter. If 
<tt>precomputedLevel</tt> or <tt>precomputedLevels</tt> are set, the precomputed
clipped graphs are loaded from the <i>file</i> directory. In this
directory, each clipped graph file must be named 
<i>file</i>_<i>level</i>_<i>tx</i>_<i>ty</i>.graph, where level, tx, ty are logical
quad coordinates. If these precomputed files do not exist they are
created at first use. The usage for precomputedLevels is that every level 
must be separated by a coma (','). You can specify a range of levels by 
placing a colon between the begin and end levels. <tt>precomputedLevel</tt> 
only allows 1 specified precomputedLevel; It is mainly here for compatibility 
with previous versions. The user can also specify whether to use the 
\link proland::Graph#flatten() flatten\endlink 
method after each \link proland::Graph#clip() clip\endlink. If you
use existing precomputed clipped graphs, they must be consistent with
that choice (i.e. they must be flattened if you selected <tt>
doFlatten</tt>="true"). Finally, the user also has the option to store 
the parent tiles of currently used tiles (<tt>storeParents</tt>). As 
said before, this option allows to accelerate the switching between 
levels but since they remain in the memory, a tile at an high level 
will take a lot more memory.

The LazyGraph cache size can also be set via the <tt>
nodeCacheSize</tt> / <tt>curveCacheSize</tt> / <tt>areaCacheSize</tt>
attributes. Finally, the maximum number of cached CurveData can also
be set with <tt>dataCacheSize</tt>. 0 means no cache, -1 means an
unbounded cache.

\subsubsection sec-graphcurvedatas CurveDatas

proland::CurveData class contains data about a
\link proland::Curve Curve\endlink. A Curve and all its children
share the same CurveData; This allows to maintain consistency between the
different levels of detail.

It Stores a flattened version of the root Curve, created by the
GraphProducer that generated that root Curve. Basically, it contains
general information about that curve: Start and End Cap lengths,
boundaries, curvilinear length and pseudo curvilinear coordinates,
and any other data you might want to add. All these datas are computed 
only the first time they are needed, and then stored for later use.

For example, \link proland::ElevationCurveData ElevationCurveDatas\endlink
stores the elevation profile of its curve. The main goal of CurveDatas is to 
avoid sampling the same point at different levels in different tiles, which 
would lead to discontinuities (unaligned or cut stripes for example). The 
CurveData informations are computed at a level which only depends on the Curve's 
width, to avoid any popping effects between levels. A nice use case for the 
curvilinear coordinates and cap lengths are the roads (see fig. below): They 
help to add a special behavior at end nodes but also all along the curve.

<embed src="graph-curvedatadraw.svg" width="35%" type="image/svg+xml"/><br/>
<div class="caption">The CurveData class contains a lot of important data for 
drawing discontinuities-free graphs. The cap lengths allow to determine where 
a curve intersects with any of her connected curves. When combined with the 
curvilinear length parameter stored for each point, it is then easy to determine 
if a stripe should be drawn or not. Also, to avoid discontinuities at tile 
borders, the same curvilinear length parameter can be used, so that we always 
know where the current point is inside the curve.</div>
</center>
\endhtmlonly

CurveDatas are handled by a proland::CurveDataFactory. By
default, this factory should be the GraphProducer itself, but it
can be changed if you need to extend CurveDatas (See
proland::ElevationGraphLayer and its subclasses: Only the
\link proland::CurveDataFactory#newCurveData() newCurveData()\endlink
method should be overriden).

The Factory works quite like a TileProducer: It provides 3 main methods:
- \link proland::CurveDataFactory#getCurveData() getCurveData()\endlink  :
If the CurveData doesn't exist, it is created. Otherwise, its usage counter
is incremented. This one should be used in the startCreateTile part of your
producers (or getTask in your tasks).
- \link proland::CurveDataFactory#findCurveData() findCurveData()\endlink :
Just returns the CurveData, without changing the usage count. This one
should be used during the execution of the task. Returns NULL if the
CurveData doesn't exist.
- \link proland::CurveDataFactory#putCurveData() putCurveData()\endlink  :
Decrements the usage counter. When a CurveData gets unused (amount of puts()
equal to the amount of gets()), it is deleted. This function should be used
in the stopCreateTile part of your producers (or at the end of your task).

CurveDataFactory may also be told which CurveDatas are used in a given
Tile, which allows to directly call the put() method for each CurveData
in that Tile. Two methods are defined for that:
- \link proland::CurveDataFactory#addUsedCurveDatas() addUsedCurveDatas()\endlink:
Determines the CurveDatas in a tile.
- \link proland::CurveDataFactory#releaseCurveData() releaseCurveData()\endlink:
Calls the put method for each CurveData in the given Tile.

Finally, the CurveDataFactory is also a GraphListener, and is therefore
able to detect when a Curve has changed and updates its CurveData.


Like TileProducers, you might want to add dependencies on CurveDatas,
which can be required in a GraphLayer for example. The
proland::GetCurveDatasTask task has been created for that purpose.
It depends on a given Graph, and calls the getCurveData() method for
each Curve in this Graph.

But sometimes, the user may need specific data about a given Curve all 
along that Curve, and thus every tile crossed by this Curve. Usually, 
this would be done in two steps, i.e. two frames (one for computing the 
graph, and one for computing the Tiles crossed by the curves from this 
Graph), which is not suitable for usual graph applications. 

GetCurveDatasTask is able to handle that: It changes the TaskGraph
DURING its execution, after the creation of the Graph and before the
execution of the Task that needs 'random' tiles. It forces the
producer to create the tiles that clip its CurveDatas before the
execution of the task where they are needed.

<img src="graph-curvedatasexample.png" width="64%">
<div class="caption">Example of ElevationCurveData: at each tile
covered by the blue area (the Curve), the Elevation layer must
know the elevation profile all along the curve. But to avoid
discontinuities, the CurveData also needs elevations from the
ElevationProducer which are not necessary all computed (out of
the screen for example).</div>
</center>

\note Remember, you should ALWAYS call the releaseCurveDatas() method
manually at the end of your task when using GetCurvedataTask, otherwise
memory will get saturated, since the CurveDatas won't get deleted.

\section sec-producers Terrain producers

The previous graph producers can be used via layers in the terrain
plugin producers, in order to generate or modify the terrain texture
or shape based on vector data (e.g. to draw and insert roads on a 
terrain). These layers are presented below.

\subsection sec-elevation Elevation producer

\subsubsection sec-elevationlayers Graph based layers

- RoadElevationLayer

The  proland::RoadElevationLayer is a proland::TileLayer
that draws roads on top of an elevation texture. It modifies the terrain
elevation so that the roads cross sections are horizontal, and so that
the road elevation profile is smooth, while ensuring a continuous
transition with the original terrain in the road footprint area.

A proland::RoadElevationLayer can be loaded with the Ork resource
framework, using the following format:
\verbatim
<roadElevationLayer name="roadOrtho1" graph="roadGraph1"
    cpuElevations="groundElevations1" renderProg="roadLayerElevationShader;"
    level="3"/>
\endverbatim

The <tt>graph</tt> attribute must contain the name of a GraphProducer
that needs to be drawn. The <tt>cpuElevations</tt> attribute must contain
the name of a TileProducer computing terrain elevations on CPU.	The
<tt>renderProg</tt> attribute must contain the ork::Program
used to render the roads. The <tt>level</tt> attribute represents the
first level at which the Layer will start being displayed. The
"graph1" example shows how this layer can be used.

- WaterElevationLayer

The proland::WaterElevationLayer is a proland::TileLayer
TileLayer\endlink that draws rivers on top of an elevation texture. It
modifies the terrain elevation so that the river cross sections are
horizontal, and so that the river elevation profile is smooth and always
decreasing (rivers cannot flow uphill), while ensuring a continuous
transition with the original terrain in the river footprint area.

A proland::WaterElevationLayer can be loaded with the Ork resource
framework, using the following format:
\verbatim
<waterElevationLayer name="waterOrtho1" graph="waterGraph1"
    cpuElevations="groundElevations1" renderProg="waterElevationOrthoShader;"
    fillProg="fillShader;" level="3"/>
\endverbatim

The <tt>graph</tt> attribute must contain the name of a GraphProducer
that needs to be drawn. The <tt>cpuElevations</tt> attribute must contain
the name of a TileProducer computing terrain elevations on CPU.	The
<tt>renderProg</tt> attribute must contain the ork::Program
used to render the small rivers. The <tt>fillProg</tt> attribute must
contain the ork::Program used to render the large rivers
and lakes. The <tt>level</tt> attribute represents the
first level at which the Layer will start being displayed. The
"river1" example shows how this layer can be used.

\subsection sec-orthogpu Ortho GPU producer

\subsubsection sec-orthogpulayers Graph based layers

- LineOrthoLayer

The proland::LineOrthoLayer is a
proland::TileLayer that draws a graph on top of an ortho
texture. The graph is drawn with OpenGL lines of one pixel width.

A proland::LineOrthoLayer can be loaded with the Ork resource
framework, using the following format:
\verbatim
<roadOrthoLayer name="lines" graph="myGraph"
    renderProg="myShader;" level="3"/>
\endverbatim

The <tt>graph</tt> attribute must contain the name of a GraphProducer
that needs to be drawn. The <tt>renderProg</tt> attribute must
contain the ork::Program used to render the lines. The
<tt>level</tt> attribute represents the first level at which the
Layer will start being displayed.

- MaskOrthoLayer

The proland::MaskOrthoLayer is a
proland::TileLayer that draws a graph on top of an ortho
texture. The graph is drawn by rasterizing its curves and areas,
with the correct widths. Many options are available to blend
the result into the current tile, to draw only in some channels,
to ignore some curves, etc. 
A typical use of this layer is to modulate a density map
texture, in order to exclude some areas defined in a graph. For 
instance, to set a grass or tree density to zero where there are
roads or rivers (to avoid instancing grass blades or trees in roads
and rivers). The "river1" example illustrates how this layer 
can be used.

A proland::MaskOrthoLayer can be loaded with the Ork resource
framework, using the following format:
\verbatim
<maskOrthoLayer name="mask" graph="myGraph"
    renderProg="myShader;" level="3"
    withFactor="1" color="255,0,0"
    ignore="1,2," deform="false"
    equation="ADD" equationAlpha="ADD" 
    destinationFunction="ZERO" sourceFunction="ONE" 
    destinationFunctionAlpha="ZERO" sourceFunctionAlpha="ONE"
    blendColor="0,0,0,0" channels="r"/>
\endverbatim

The <tt>graph</tt> attribute must contain the name of a GraphProducer
that needs to be drawn. The <tt>renderProg</tt> attribute must
contain the ork::Program used to render the lines. The
<tt>level</tt> attribute represents the first level at which the
Layer will start being displayed. The <tt>withFactor</tt> attribute 
is a factor applied to the curve widths before drawing these curves,
and the <tt>color</tt> attribute is the color used to draw the curves
and areas. The <tt>ignore</tt> attribute specifies a list of curve
types which must be skipped when drawing the graph. Finally the
<tt>deform</tt> attribute must specify which
terrain deformation will be applied to the terrain. Currently only
the "none" and "sphere" values are supported, meaning that the
terrain will not be deformed, or will be deformed into a sphere (for
planet rendering).
The last attributes specify the blending modes and equations
to blend the layer into the produced tiles, as well as the masks
used to write only in some channels (r, g, b, and/or a).

- RoadOrthoLayer

The proland::RoadOrthoLayer is a
proland::TileLayer that draws roads on top of an ortho
texture. Roads drawing depends on the resolution of the display.
If the width of the road is smaller than a pixel, the road will
be drawn with lines, else, with a triangle strip. In addition, a
quality parameter can be set in order to decide whether to draw
road stripes, crossroads etc. or not. The "graph1" example
illustrates how this layer can be used.

A proland::RoadOrthoLayer can be loaded with the Ork resource
framework, using the following format:
\verbatim
<roadOrthoLayer name="roadOrtho1" graph="roadGraph1"
    renderProg="roadLayerOrthoShader;" level="3"
    color="64,64,64" dirt="154,121,7" border="43,68,20"
    border_width="1.2" inner_border_width="2.0"
    deform="false"/>
\endverbatim

The <tt>graph</tt> attribute must contain the name of a GraphProducer
that needs to be drawn. The <tt>renderProg</tt> attribute must
contain the ork::Program used to render the roads. The
<tt>level</tt> attribute represents the first level at which the
Layer will start being displayed. The <tt>color</tt> attribute contains
the color of roads, in RGB format. The <tt>dirt</tt> attribute contains
the color of small roads (width 1.0), in RGB format. The <tt>border</tt>
attribute contains the color of road borders, in RGB format.
Finally, the <tt>border_width</tt> and <tt>inner_border_width</tt> are
the size of border (outter and inner borders) added to roads when
drawing (the <tt>deform</tt> attribute has the same meaning as above).

- WaterOrthoLayer

The proland::WaterOrthoLayer is a proland::TileLayer
that draws static rivers on top of an ortho texture. In this Layer,
proland::Area represent large rivers and lakes and
proland::Curve are drawn as small rivers.

A WaterOrhoLayer can be loaded with the Ork resource framework,
using the following format:
\verbatim
<waterOrthoLayer name="waterOrtho1" graph="waterGraph1"
    renderProg="waterLayerOrthoShader;" level="3" 
    color="255,0,255" deform="false"/>
\endverbatim

The <tt>graph</tt> attribute must contain the name of a GraphProducer
that needs to be drawn. The <tt>renderProg</tt> attribute must contain
the ork::Program used to render the rivers. The <tt>level</tt>
attribute represents the first level at which the Layer will start
being displayed. Finally, the <tt>color</tt> attribute contains the
color of rivers, in RGB format. In this example the river will be purple.
The <tt>deform</tt> attribute has the same meaning as above.
