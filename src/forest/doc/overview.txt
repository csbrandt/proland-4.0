<br/><h1>Proland Documentation - Forest Plugin</h1>
\endhtmlonly

The forest plugin provides a task to draw instantiated trees or
other objects on a terrain. <i>This plugin does not depend on
any other plugin</i>.

The above task uses a producer that generates
a set of points per terrain quad, based on data produced by other
producers. The points are generated by removing points from precomputed
point patterns, and by computing attributes for the remaining points
(such as an elevation, using an external elevation producer, a normal,
using an external normal producer, etc). The decision to keep or remove
a point being made based on a density map, using an external
ortho producer.

During rendering, the union of the point sets for all the visible leaf
quads is drawn with a single draw call, with a shader that can then
generate camera facing quads from these points, place them on the 
terrain, and finally texture and shade them.

The main classes of this module are the following:
<ul>
<li>the proland::PlantProducer
is the producer that generates the point sets for each terrain quad.
The produced points are stored in a tile storage based on a vertex buffer
object, which can be retrieved with proland::PlantProducer#getPlantsMesh.
The subparts of this buffer corresponding to the generated points for
the currently visible leaf quads are given by the proland::PlantProducer#offsets,
proland::PlantProducer#sizes and proland::PlantProducer#count fields,
updated by the proland::PlantProducer#produceTiles method.</li>
<li>the proland::DrawPlantsShadowTask is a task that calls the 
above proland::PlantProducer#produceTiles method. It can then,
optionnaly, draw these points in a cascaded shadow map. For this,
this task first computes the shadow frustums based on the bounding boxes
of the leaf terrain quads, and then draws the point with a shader that
can then generate light facing quads from these points, place them on
the terrain, and finally texture them.</li>
<li>the proland::DrawPlantTask is the task that draws the points on 
screen. It is intended to be used with a shader that generates camera
facing quads from these points, places them on the 
terrain, and finally textures and shades them.</li>
</ul>

\note the position of each generated point is computed relatively to
a given reference point. When the camera moves too far away from 
this reference point, all the generated points are recomputed 
relatively to a new reference, equal to the current camera 
position. We do this to ensure that the point coordinates remain 
small, in order to avoid numerical precision problems. Like for the 
ocean case, all computations are done in a local reference frame 
moving with the camera. Shaders have access to the position of the
current reference point in this moving frame in order to transform
the generated points in screen space in a correct way.

The "trees1" example illustrates how these tasks can be used, without 
shadow maps, and on a flat terrain. The "earth" examples show how they
can be used with cascaded shadow maps, on a spherical terrain.
