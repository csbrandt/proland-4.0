\section sec-intro Introduction

The Proland edit plugin provides extended terrain and graph 
producers allowing the real-time edition of their data. <i>This
plugin requires the terrain, graph and river plugins at compile
time, but only those actually used are needed at runtime (e.g. if
you only use the extended terrain plugin producers, then you 
don't need the graph and river plugins to use this plugin).</i>

\section sec-edit Terrain edition

Terrain edition capabilities are provided via elevation and ortho
producer subclasses to edit elevation and ortho maps, and via a dedicated
layer to edit graphs. They allow the interactive edition of the terrain
shape, of any terrain map (color map, tree density map, etc), and of terrain
graphs. Then, any data that depend on edited data (such as terrain normals)
is automatically recomputed via the producer framework, based on the 
Ork task scheduling framework. The "edit1", "edit2", "edit3", and 
"edit4" examples illustrate these terrain edition features.

\subsection sec-edit-dem Edit Elevation producer

Terrain elevations can be edited by using the proland::EditResidualProducer
and proland::EditElevationProducer classes together, instead of
the proland::ResidualProducer and proland::ElevationProducer classes.

The proland::EditResidualProducer is a subclass of proland::ResidualProducer
that stores in memory a set of modified tiles. When asked to produce a tile,
this producer first look in the previous set to see if a modified version
of this tile is available in memory. If so it simply returns this tile.
Otherwise it delegates the tile production to its super class, which will
load the tile from disk.

The proland::EditResidualProducer#editedTile method is used to notify this
producer that a new version of a tile is available. This method takes as
parameter logical tile coordinates, as well as the <i>difference</i>
between the current and the new version of the tile. When all modified tiles
have been notified with this method, the 
proland::EditResidualProducer#updateResiduals must be called to recompute
the residual tiles at all levels in the quadtree, using the upsampling 
filter defined in \ref sec-residual.

The proland::EditElevationProducer is a subclass of proland::ElevationProducer
with two main additional methods:
<ul>
<li>the first one, proland::EditElevationProducer#edit, takes as parameter
a 2D path in local
terrain physical coordinates, and draws this path in the fourth channel of
the elevation tiles in the cache (this channel is supposed unused). It then blends
this fourth channel into the third one (containing the modified elevations).</li>
<li>the second method, proland::EditElevationProducer#update, reads backs
the modified tiles on CPU, computes the differences between the current
and new elevations (i.e. between the first and third channels), sends them
to the residual producer with proland::EditResidualProducer#editedTile, and
finally asks the residual producer to recompute the residuals with 
proland::EditResidualProducer#updateResiduals.</li>
</ul>

\note the proland::EditElevationProducer can <b>not</b> have layers. Indeed,
the modifications produced by any layer would be incorporated in the residual
tiles at the first edition attempt, which is not a desired behavior. The 
workaround for this is to use two elevation producers: a first edit elevation
producer, without layers, and a normal elevation producer, with a 
proland::TextureLayer to copy the tiles from the first producer, and other
layers to modify these copied tiles (not the original ones).

The "edit1" example shows how proland::EditResidualProducer and
proland::EditElevationProducer can be used.

\subsection sec-edit-ortho Edit Ortho producer

Terrain maps (color map, density map, etc) can be edited by using the 
proland::EditOrthoCPUProducer
and proland::EditOrthoProducer classes together, instead of
the proland::OrthoCPUProducer and proland::OrthoProducer classes.

The proland::EditOrthoCPUProducer is a subclass of proland::OrthoCPUProducer
that stores in memory a set of modified tiles. When asked to produce a tile,
this producer first look in the previous set to see if a modified version
of this tile is available in memory. If so it simply returns this tile.
Otherwise it delegates the tile production to its super class, which will
load the tile from disk.

The proland::EditOrthoCPUProducer#editedTile method is used to notify this
producer that a new version of a tile is available. This method takes as
parameter logical tile coordinates, as well as the <i>difference</i>
between the current and the new version of the tile. When all modified tiles
have been notified with this method, the 
proland::EditOrthoCPUProducer#updateResiduals must be called to recompute
the residual tiles at all levels in the quadtree, using the upsampling 
filter defined in \ref sec-ortho.

The proland::EditOrthoProducer is a subclass of proland::OrthoProducer
with two main additional methods:
<ul>
<li>the first one, proland::EditElevationProducer#edit, takes as parameter
a 2D path in local
terrain physical coordinates, and draws this path (with some blending) in
the ortho tiles in the cache (before that it reads these tiles back on CPU,
in order to be able to compute color differences later on).</li>
<li>the second method, proland::EditOrthoProducer#update, reads backs
the modified tiles on CPU, computes the differences between the current
and new colors (using the copy made before edition - see above), sends them
to the residual producer with proland::EditOrthoCPUProducer#editedTile, and
finally asks the residual producer to recompute the residuals with 
proland::EditOrthoCPUProducer#updateResiduals.</li>
</ul>

\note the proland::EditOrthoProducer can <b>not</b> have layers. Indeed,
the modifications produced by any layer would be incorporated in the residual
tiles at the first edition attempt, which is not a desired behavior. The 
workaround for this is to use two ortho producers: a first edit ortho
producer, without layers, and a normal ortho producer, with a 
proland::TextureLayer to copy the tiles from the first producer, and other
layers to modify these copied tiles (not the original ones).

The "edit2" example shows how proland::EditOrthoCPUProducer and
proland::EditOrthoProducer can be used.

\subsection sec-edit-graph Edit Graph Ortho layer

The \link proland::EditGraphOrthoLayer EditGraphOrthoLayer \endlink class
is a \link proland::TileLayer TileLayer\endlink that draws
the control points of an unflattened Graph on tiles produced by an
\link proland::OrthoGPUProducer OrthoGPUProducer \endlink,
and allows the user to edit it interactively. Changes will then be
propagated to the GraphListeners that share the same root Graph
via the \link proland::Graph#notifyListeners() notifyListeners()\endlink
method.  \link proland::EditGraphOrthoLayer EditGraphOrthoLayer \endlink class
uses Graph Tiles produced by a
\link proland::GraphProducer GraphProducer \endlink. It contains
a vector of GraphProducers, so it can switch between them via the
\link proland::EditGraphOrthoLayer#setEditedGraph() setEditedGraph() \endlink
method, and then display and edit different Graphs corresponding
to each of these GraphProducers.

This class also provides the functions to edit the Graph. You can :
- \link proland::EditGraphOrthoLayer#select() Select\endlink a
point or a segment of a Curve. This point/segment will then be used
for edition functions, until you select another point.
- \link proland::EditGraphOrthoLayer#movePoint() Move\endlink a point.
- \link proland::EditGraphOrthoLayer#addCurve() Add\endlink a
Curve (From 0, 1 or 2 existing Nodes).
- \link proland::EditGraphOrthoLayer#addNode() Split\endlink a
Curve / \link proland::EditGraphOrthoLayer#removeNode() Merge\endlink
2 Curves.
- \link proland::EditGraphOrthoLayer#removeCurve() Remove\endlink a Curve.
- \link proland::EditGraphOrthoLayer#addControlPoint() Add\endlink
or \link proland::EditGraphOrthoLayer#removeControlPoint() remove\endlink
a point from a Curve.
- \link proland::EditGraphOrthoLayer#removeNode() Remove\endlink
a point linking several Curves.
- \link proland::EditGraphOrthoLayer#transformControlPoint() Transform\endlink
a ControlPoint.
- \link proland::EditGraphOrthoLayer#fitCurve() Create\endlink a smoothed curved by 
pressing SHIFT while moving the mouse.
- Smooth a point by selecting it and pressing CTRL while moving the move.

An EditGraphOrthoLayer can be loaded with the Ork resource framework,
using the following format:
\verbatim
<editGraphLayer name="myEditGraphLayer"
   graphs="myFirstGraphProducer,anotherGraphProducer,yetAnotherGraphProducer"
   level = "3" softEdition="true" softEditionDelay="0.1"/>
\endverbatim

The <tt>graphs</tt> attribute must contain the names of the different
GraphProducers that we want to be managed by this EditGraphOrthoLayer.
In this example, 3 GraphProducers will be used.
The <tt>level</tt> attribute represents the first level at which the
Layer will start being displayed. Finally, a <tt>softEdition</tt> mode can be enabled. It allows
to only update the graph when releasing the mouse. If set to false, the graph will be updated every 
<tt>softEditionDelay</tt> seconds.

The "edit3" example shows how proland::EditGraphOrthoLayer can be used.

\subsection sec-edit-hydrograph Edit HydroGraph Ortho layer

This editor is just the same as the previous one, but adds a few functionnalities 
related to HydroGraphs.
- Change the potential of a curve.
- Link a bank and its river axis.
- Dynamically and automatically link newly created banks to nearest river axis. 
If the result is not satisfying for the user, there is always the possibility to 
manually edit the result afterwards.

The "edit4" example shows how proland::EditHydroGraphOrthoLayer can be used.
