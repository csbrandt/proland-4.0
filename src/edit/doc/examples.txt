\section sec-edit1 Edit1 example

\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly

This example is based on the "terrain3" example from the terrain plugin,
with two modifications:
first the elevation producer is replaced with an edit elevation producer,
allowing dynamic terrain shape modifications, and second the main
window class is converted to an Ork resource, for greater flexibility.

To edit the terrain, click or drag the mouse while holding the SHIFT key pressed.
You can also change the brush radius with the mouse wheel, while holding
the SHIFT key pressed. See also the tweak bar to configure the edition
tool. Press "e" to enable and disable terrain edition.

\subsection sec-terrain5-editdem Dynamic terrain edition

In order to allow dynamic terrain edition, the default elevation producer
must be replaced with a proland::EditElevationProducer. This producer
requires an associated residual producer (unlike the default elevation
producer; also it cannot have layers). So we first start by defining
a residual producer (here without any associated file, which means that
we will start with a completely flat terrain):

\dontinclude edit1/helloworld.xml
\skip groundResiduals
\until editResidualProducer

We can then use this residual producer to define our edit elevation
producer:

\dontinclude edit1/helloworld.xml
\skip editElevationProducer
\until terrainShader

Here we need to specify the scene node using this producer, in the
"terrain" attribute, as well as the shader used to render the terrain,
in the "edit" shader (this shader will be responsible to draw the 
edition brush on the terrain), and the shader defining how brush
strokes modify the terrain elevations, in the "brush" attribute.

Note that, in order to specify the terrain scene node, this scene node
must be a valid resource, identified by its name. In the "terrain3"
example this terrain node is declared directly as a subnode of the scene
graph node, and so cannot be loaded separately from the whole scene. In order
to solve this problem we move its definition outside the definition of the
scene graph node, and we then simply reference it:

\dontinclude edit1/helloworld.xml
\skip name="terrainNode"
\until "t"

We finally add a tweak bar allowing the user to configure the terrain edition
tool, and to reset the terrain to its original shape:

\dontinclude edit1/helloworld.xml
\skip tweakDem
\until /tweakBarManager

We set its active state to "true" so that it is active by default when the
application starts. We also associate the shortcut key "e" to this tweak
bar, in order to activate or deactivate it with this key. We finally
specify that this tweak bar can not be active at the same time as another
bar, with the "exclusive" flag.

The "brushShader.glsl" file defines how brush strokes modify the terrain
elevations. This shader is given as input the positions and radiuses of the
extremities of a stroke segment (it is executed once per segment), in 
"stroke" and "strokeEnd", as well as a brush "elevation", in 
"brushElevation". It must output an elevation at each point p in the
alpha channel, which will then be blended with the current terrain elevations.
In this particular implementation the output is computed based on the 
distance from p to the stroke segment, using a smoothstep function of this
distance (but other choices are possible, you can modify this shader as
you want).

The "initShader.glsl" and "composeShader.glsl" are shaders that are needed
by the proland::EditElevationProducer, with these exact names. They are
used to initialize a tile before drawing brush strokes in it ("initShader"
must copy the current elevations from "initSampler" in the rgb channels, 
reset the blue channel to the red channel, and
reset the alpha channel to 0), and to compose the current elevations with 
the brush strokes ("composeShader" must update the modified elevation in 
the blue channel by composing it with the brush elevation in the alpha
channel - in this implementation the two are simply added, but you can
change this if needed).

Finally the edition brush is displayed on the terrain with the following
additional code in "terrainShader.glsl":

\dontinclude edit1/terrainShader.glsl
\skip pencil.xy
\until }

where "pencil" and "pencilColor" are uniforms set by the event handler
associated with the terrain edition tweak bar (in the shader specified
in the "edit" attribute of the edit elevation producer, here 
"terrainShader").

\subsection sec-terrain5-windowres Window resource

In this example, for greater flexibility, the main window class is converted
to an Ork resource. We can thus declare and configure it in the "helloworld.xml"
archive file:

\dontinclude edit1/helloworld.xml
\skip <helloworld
\until <helloworld

where "viewHandler" is the proland::BasicViewHandler, now declared as an Ork
resource as well:

\dontinclude edit1/helloworld.xml
\skip <basicViewHandler
\until <basicViewHandler

which allows us to also declare the link between the tweak bar manager
event handler and the view event handler in the resources, with the
"next" attribute (see \ref sec-terrain3-ui):

\dontinclude edit1/helloworld.xml
\skip <tweakBarManager
\until <tweakBarManager

Finally, to convert the HelloWorld C++ class into an Ork resource we mainly
need to move the code in the HelloWorld constructor to the main function
(because the constructor will now be called by the Ork resource loading
mechanism, which must therefore be initialized before that) and to the
constructor of a subclass, inheriting from ork::Resource, and defined as
follows:

\dontinclude edit1/HelloWorld.cpp
\skip class HelloWorldResource
\until };

ResourceTemplate is a C++ class template inheriting from ork::Resource and
from the class specified as second template argument (the first argument
is a priority to order resources during loading). Most of the code is in
the constructor. This code checks that the XML attributes of the resource
declaration are amongst "name", "ui", "view" and "radius". It then loads
the "ui" and "view" resources to initialize the scene manager, in a similar
way as in the original constructor of the "terrain3" example. A noticeable
difference is that, depending on the value of "radius", a planet view
controller or a "flat" view controller is instantiated. 

The last step to be able to use this resource from an XML file is to declare
the association between an XML tag name and the HelloWorldResource class.
This is done as follows:

\dontinclude edit1/HelloWorld.cpp
\skip helloworld[]
\until static

The result of these changes is that it is now possible to choose the user
interface components, the view handler and the kind of terrain (flat or 
spherical) without needing to recompile the main C++ class, i.e., only by
changing the "helloworld.xml" file.

\section sec-edit2 Edit2 example

\htmlonly
<img src="edit2.png"><br/>
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html edit2.png
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

This example is based on the "edit1" example, but with an ortho texture
editor instead of an elevation editor (note: in this example we edit
a texture which is directly used to render the terrain, but it is of
course possible to edit any texture, like a tree density map for instance).

To edit the terrain texture, click or drag the mouse while holding the 
SHIFT key pressed. You can also change the brush radius with the mouse 
wheel, while holding the SHIFT key pressed. See also the tweak bar to 
configure the edition tool. Press "c" to enable and disable terrain
texture edition.

In order to allow dynamic terrain texture edition, the default ortho producer
must be replaced with a proland::EditOrthoProducer. This producer
requires an associated residual producer (unlike the default ortho
producer; also it cannot have layers). So we first start by defining
a residual producer (here without any associated file, which means that
we will start with a completely black terrain):

\dontinclude edit2/helloworld.xml
\skip groundOrthoCpu
\until editOrthoCpuProducer

We can then use this residual producer to define our edit ortho
producer:

\dontinclude edit2/helloworld.xml
\skip editOrthoProducer
\until terrainShader

Here we need to specify the scene node using this producer, in the
"terrain" attribute, as well as the shader used to render the terrain,
in the "edit" shader (this shader will be responsible to draw the 
edition brush on the terrain), and the shader defining how brush
strokes modify the terrain texture, in the "brush" attribute.

We finally add a tweak bar allowing the user to configure the terrain edition
tool, and to reset the terrain texture to its original value:

\dontinclude edit2/helloworld.xml
\skip tweakOrtho
\until /tweakBarManager

We set its active state to "true" so that it is active by default when the
application starts. We also associate the shortcut key "c" to this tweak
bar, in order to activate or deactivate it with this key. We finally
specify that this tweak bar can not be active at the same time as another
bar, with the "exclusive" flag.

The "brushShader.glsl" file defines how brush strokes modify the terrain
texture. This shader is given as input the positions and radiuses of the
extremities of a stroke segment (it is executed once per segment), in 
"stroke" and "strokeEnd". It must output an alpha value at each point p, 
which will be used to blend the brush color with the current texture values.
In this particular implementation the output is computed based on the 
distance from p to the stroke segment, using a smoothstep function of this
distance (but other choices are possible, you can modify this shader as
you want).

The "initOrthoShader.glsl" and "composeOrthoShader.glsl" are shaders that are needed
by the proland::EditOrthoProducer, with these exact names. They are
used to initialize a tile before drawing brush strokes in it ("initShader"
must copy the current colors from "initSampler"), and to compose the current colors
with the brush color ("composeShader" must compose the current colors in 
"sourceSampler" with the brush color in "brushColor", based on the alpha mask
in "brushSampler" - in this implementation a simple alpha blending is done, but
you can change this if needed).

Finally the edition brush is displayed on the terrain with the following
additional code in "terrainShader.glsl":

\dontinclude edit2/terrainShader.glsl
\skip pencil.xy
\until }

where "pencil" and "pencilColor" are uniforms set by the event handler
associated with the terrain edition tweak bar (in the shader specified
in the "edit" attribute of the edit elevation producer, here 
"terrainShader").

\section sec-edit3 Edit3 example

\htmlonly
<img src="edit3.png"><br/>
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html edit3.png
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

This example adds interactive graph edition capabilities to the
"graph1" example from the graph plugin 
(based on the paper "Real-time rendering and
editing of vector-based terrains", Eric Bruneton and Fabrice 
Neyret, Eurographics 2008). 
Press "e" to enable and disable this feature.
When enabled, you can move the control points with the mouse, 
insert new control points at the current mouse position with
the Insert key, delete the selected point or curve with the End
key, etc. You can also right click on a control point or curve
to perform various operations on them. Finally the tweak bar can
be used to modify the width of the selected curve).

Enabling this feature is quite easy. We first add a 
proland::EditGraphOrthoLayer to the ortho GPU producer. This
layer is responsible to draw the control points and curves
when the edition mode is enabled (note that we removed the 
precomputed texture, replaced with an empty ortho layer; the
"backgroundCache" attribute is thus no longer necessary):

\dontinclude edit3/helloworld.xml
\skip <orthoGpuProducer
\until </orthoGpuProducer 

Here we specify that this layer will be used to edit the "roads"
graph (you can specify multiple graphs here, separated with commas),
in the "terrainNode" scene node, and that the control points and
curves will be rendered with the "editLayerShader" shader. This shader
is really basic, it simply selects a color based on the vertex z
coordinate, which encodes the type of this vertex (selected or not,
curve node or curve control point, etc).

Finally we add a proland::TweakGraphLayer tweak bar to control 
this layer, as follows:

\skip tweakGraphLayer
\until /tweakBarManager

And that's it!

\section sec-edit4 Edit4 example

\htmlonly
<img src="edit4.png"><br/>
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html edit4.png
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

This example adds interactive graph edition capabilities to the
"river1" example from the river plugin
(press "e" to enable and disable this feature.
When enabled, you can move the control points with the mouse, 
insert new control points at the current mouse position with
the Insert key, delete the selected point or curve with the End
key, etc. You can also right click on a control point or curve
to perform various operations on them. Finally the tweak bar can
be used to modify the width and type of the selected curve).

Enabling this feature is quite easy. We first add a 
proland::EditHydroGraphOrthoLayer to the ortho GPU producer. This
layer is responsible to draw the control points and curves
when the edition mode is enabled:

\dontinclude edit4/helloworld.xml
\skip <orthoGpuProducer
\until </orthoGpuProducer 

Here we specify that this layer will be used to edit the "water"
graph (you can specify multiple graphs here, separated with commas),
in the "terrainNode" scene node, and that the control points and
curves will be rendered with the "editLayerShader" shader.

Finally we add a proland::TweakHydroGraphLayer tweak bar to control
this layer, as follows (we also add a proland::TweakRivers tweak bar
to control the draw river task, but this is not necessary to simply
edit the river graph):

\skip tweakHydroGraphLayer
\until /tweakBarManager

And that's it!
