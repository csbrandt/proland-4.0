This example is a minimal example using only the proland terrain framework
(see \ref sec-terrain), without any producer. It simply uses a dynamic
quadtree, and draws each terrain quad with an OpenGL quad and a simple
shader.

\subsection sec-helloworld-main Main class

The main class is defined as follows:

\dontinclude helloworld/HelloWorld.cpp

\skip <stdlib.h>
\until bool rotate;

Here we simply include the headers we need, and declare a subclass of
ork::GlutWindow. This class will define what must be drawn at each
frame, and how mouse and keyboard events must be handled. For this
it uses a ork::SceneManager, i.e., the scene to be rendered, as well
as a proland::TerrainViewController to hold the current camera position,
and three additional fields to handle mouse events.

\until Logger::ERROR_LOGGER

The constructor first sets up some Ork loggers. By default the DEBUG
logger is null, and the INFO, WARNING and ERROR logger simply log to
the command line. Here we create file loggers around the default loggers,
in order to also log events into the "log.html" file.

\until setResourceManager

We then create a resource loader, and configure it to load resources
from the current directory and from the "helloworld.xml" archive file.
Then we create a resource manager using this loader, and a ork::SceneManager
using this resource manager.

\until setCameraMethod

We finally configure the scene manager: we set its task scheduler by loading
it with the resource loader, we set its scene graph by loading it with the
resource loader, and we finally define which node and method to use for the
camera.

\until TerrainViewController
\until }

As a last step in this constructor, we create an object that will hold the
current camera position, and which will also set the corresponding 
transformation matrices in the camera node (given by 
<tt>manager->getCameraNode()</tt>). 2500.0 is the initial camera altitude.

\until ERROR_LOGGER != NULL
\until ERROR_LOGGER->flush
\until }
\until }

The redisplay method defines how the scene must be rendered at each frame.
Its implementation is very simple, as most of the work is done by the scene
manager. The first two lines copy the camera position stored in the view
controller into the scene node corresponding to the camera. The following
lines clear the screen, update the scene graph, and draw it on screen. 
Finally the overriden redisplay method is called to actually display
the new frame (this method internally calls glutSwapBuffer).

\until GlutWindow::reshape
\until }

The reshape method is called when the window is resized. It simply updates
the viewport of the screen framebuffer to match the new window size.

\until updateResources
\until }
\until }

The idle method is called when no other event occured. Its damaged argument
indicates whether a part of the window has been uncovered by another window
since the last call to this method, or if the window just got the focus. If
it is the case, we check if resources have changed on disk, and if so we
update them (all this is done by the updateResources method).

\until WHEEL_UP
\until return true;
\until }

The mouseClick, mouseMotion and mouseWheel methods implement a simple
user interface to navigate in the terrain. A mouse drag translates the
camera, while a mouse drag with CTRL rotates the camera around the point
of the terrain which is at the center of the screen. Finally the mouse 
wheel moves the camera closer or farther away from this "center point". These
methods are implemented by modifying the x0 and y0 fields in the view 
controller (which correspond to the terrain coordinates of the center point),
its theta and phi fields (which correspond to the camera orientation around
the center point), and its d field (which corresponds to the distance between
the camera and the center point).

\until break;
\until return true;
\until }

The keyTyped and specialKey method handle keyboard events. Here they
simply stop the program when ESC (ASCII code 27) is pressed, and update
the resources when F5 is pressed.

\until return 0;
\until }

The rest of the code simply declares a static instance of the HelloWorld
window, creates this instance, and starts the event loop. The atexit call
ensures that Object::exit is called when the application stops, in order
to clean up everything before exiting.

\subsection sec-helloworld-res Resources

The above code is fairly generic, and its result mainly depends on how
the scene graph is defined. This scene graph is defined in the following
"helloworld.xml" archive file:

\dontinclude helloworld/helloworld.xml
\skip <?xml
\until multithreadScheduler

The first resource defined in this archive is the scheduler. Here it is
a multithread scheduler using 3 threads (which is not really necessary
here for such a simple example).

\until /sequence

The second resource is the camera method, which defines how the whole
scene must be rendered. Here this method calls the "update" method
on each scene node having the "dynamic" flag, and then calls the
"draw" method on each scene node having the "object" flag".

\until terrainNode

The third resource is the terrain. Here we define a terrain of size 500
(i.e. its bounding box will be [-500,500]x[-500,500]), whose altitudes are
between -1 and 1, and which will be subdivided with a split factor of 2,
up to the quadtree level 7 at most.

\until /sequence

The fourth resource is the "update" method for the scene node corresponding
to the terrain. This method simply calls the proland::UpdateTerrainTask,
which subdivides the terrain quadtree based on the current camera position.
The terrain is supposed to be defined by the "terrain" field of the scene
node on which this method is called.

\until /sequence

The fifth resource is the "draw" method for the scene node corresponding
to the terrain. This method sets the shader whose id in the terrain scene
node is "material" and then calls the proland::DrawTerrainTask to draw
each visible leaf quad of the terrain, by drawing the mesh whose id
in the terrain scene node is "grid" (using the previous shader).
As above, the terrain is supposed to be defined by the "terrain" field
of the scene node on which this method is called.

\until module

This resource defines the shader that will be used to draw each terrain
quad. It simply specifies the GLSL version of this shader, and the file
that contain the shader source code.

\until /archive

Finally the last resource defines the scene graph, using the previously
defined resources (resource can in fact be defined in any order). This scene
graph contains only two nodes. The first one is the camera node, which
only contains one method, the one to draw the scene (defined above). The 
second node corresponds to the terrain. It has two flags, "object" and
"dynamic" (cf the definition of the camera method). Its bounding box
is defined, consistently with the terrain size (see above). The "terrain"
field required by the updateTerrainMethod and drawTerrainMethod methods
is set to the "myTerrain" terrain, defined above. The "grid"
mesh required by the drawTerrainMethod method is set to the mesh defined
in the "quad.mesh" file. Similarly, the "material" shader required by
the drawTerrainMethod is set to the "terrainShader" module defined above.
Finally the "draw" and "update" methods called by the camera method are
set to the "drawTerrainMethod" and "updateTerrainMethod" defined above.

In order to complete the scene graph description, we simply need to 
provide the "quad.mesh" and "terrainShader.glsl" files. The first one
is very simple:

\include helloworld/quad.mesh

It specifies a mesh whose bounding box is [0,1]x[0,1]x[0,0], made of
triangle strips, whose vertices have a single attribute, made of 3 
unnormalized floats. The 4 vertices are then specified, and
the last 0 indicates that this mesh is not indexed. In fact it is a simple
quad made of two triangles.

The terrain shader is also quite simple:

\dontinclude helloworld/terrainShader.glsl
\skip uniform struct
\until _FRAGMENT_
\until #endif

The deformation uniforms are set by the proland::DrawTerrainTask before
drawing each terrain quad. Here we only need the "offset" and "localToScreen"
values. The "offset" value indicates how the [0,1]x[0,1] vertex coordinates must 
be transformed to get the terrain physical coordinates for this quad. 
The "localToScreen" matrix transforms these physical coordinates to screen
coordinates. Both uniforms are used in the vertex shader to compute 
gl_Position. The fragment shader is a simple "procedural shader" based
on the physical coordinates p output by the vertex shader. The last line
produces a "checkerboard pattern" to easily see the terrain quads, i.e,
to show how the terrain quadtree is subdivided when the camera moves.
