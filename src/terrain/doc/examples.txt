\section sec-terrain1 Terrain1 example

\htmlonly
<img src="terrain1.png"><br/>
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html terrain1.png
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

This example extends the helloworld example from the Proland Core 
documentation with the use of an elevation
producer and of a normal producer. The HelloWorld.cpp file is exactly the
same (except the constants related to the terrain size). The only 
differences are in the resource files, thereby showing that the previous
C++ code is in fact quite generic.

The first differences are in the "helloworld.xml" file:

\dontinclude terrain1/helloworld.xml
\skip tileCache
\until normalProducer

First a tile cache is defined to store up to 512 elevation tiles of 
size 101x101 (including borders). This cache is then used to define
an elevation producer. This producer does not have any associated
residual producer. It will therefore generate a random fractal
terrain, based on the provided noise amplitudes. The upsampling and
add program is not specified, and is therefore equal to its default
value, "upsampleShader;".
Then another tile cache is defined to store up to 512 normal tiles
of size 97x97, with only two 8 bits components per pixel. This 
cache is then used to define a normal producer, based on the 
previous elevation producer.

\skip updateTerrainMethod
\until /sequence

The updateTerrainMethod is also modified, in order to add a call
to the proland::UpdateTileSamplersTask. This task produces the tiles
for new terrain quads, if any, generated by the update terrain task.
It also releases the tiles for deleted terrain quads, if any, so that
they can be evicted from the cache if necessary.

\skip terrainNode     
\until /node

Finally the terrain node is also modified, in order to associate
tile samplers to the terrain. These two tile samplers are linked
to the previously defined producers. The corresponding GLSL
uniform names are declared in the "sampler" attributes.

The other resource files are modified as well, compared to the
helloworld example. The "quad.mesh" now contains a grid made of
24x24 quads. The "terrainShader.glsl" now contains two new uniforms,
"elevationSampler" and "fragmentNormalSampler", of type 
"samplerTile" defined at the beginning of the shader. They are used
in the vertex and fragment shaders via the "textureTile" function 
(also defined at the begining of the shader), which is very similar
to a builtin GLSL "texture" function call. The "camera" and "blending"
uniforms are now used to compute a continuous level of details for
elevations in the vertex shader, as explained in \ref sec-quadblend.

Finally two new shaders are defined, to produce the elevation and normal
tiles on GPU. These are basic versions of these shaders, only applicable
for non spherical terrains. The upsampling filter can be found in the
upsampleMatrix array in "upsampleShader.glsl".

\note this simple example is sufficient to illustrate the automatic
update of produced data when inputs and/or producing algorithms are
changed. While the example is running, edit the values in the "noise"
attribute of the elevationProducer resource in "helloworld.xml" with a text 
editor. When you select the example window again you should immediately see the effect
of these changes on the terrain (if not press F5). You can also edit
"terrainShader.glsl" and "upsampleShader.glsl" while the program is running,
and see the effects of these changes immediately on the terrain. For 
instance you can comment the line 52 in "terrainShader" ("data = 
vec4(0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0);") to disable the specific rendering of "ocean"
parts. You can also change the line 97 in "upsampleShader" with
"data = vec4(zf, zc, zf, 0.0);", in order to disable the flattening
of "ocean" parts.

\section sec-terrain2 Terrain2 example

\htmlonly
<img src="terrain2.png"><br/>
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html terrain2.png
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

This example is very similar to the previous one, but adapted to the
case of a spherical terrain, i.e., a planet. Here again the HelloWorld.cpp
file is almost exactly the same as in the previous example. The only 
difference is that the TerrainViewController is replaced with a
PlanetViewController.

The main differences are in the definition of the scene graph, in the
"helloworld.xml" file. The tile caches for the elevation and normal tiles
are unchanged, but the producers using these caches are modified. First,
instead of one elevation and one normal producer, we define six elevation
producers and six normal producers (one per face of a cube enclosing the
sphere):

\dontinclude terrain2/helloworld.xml
\skip tileCache
\until groundNormals6

The six elevation producers share the same elevation tile cache,
and similarly for the normal producers. The normal producers have the
<tt>deform="sphere"</tt> attribute, indicating that normals will
be mapped on a sphere (this is important to compute normals correctly).

\skip earth1
\until earth6

Similarly, instead of one terrain, we now have six, with a spherical
deformation.

\skip earth1
\until /node
\until /node

Finally, we also have six scene nodes, corresponding to the six terrains
(here only the first two are shown).
Each node is defined as in the previous example. The only difference is
that some nodes are rotated to orient them like the six faces of a cube 
enclosing the sphere (no translation is necessary, because it is handled
by the spherical deformation).

The "terrainShader.glsl" is also modified, compared to the previous
example. First there are more uniforms
related to the terrain deformation, because we are using here a spherical
deformation (instead of the identity deformation, i.e, no deformation).
The vertex shader is also more complex. It uses these new uniforms to
compute the screen projection of the terrain vertices as described in
\ref sec-spheredeform. Also the fragment shader converts the normal
to world space with the "deformation.tangentFrameToWorld" matrix before
doing lighting computation with it (it also uses a slighty more elaborate
procedural method to compute the terrain color, but there is nothing
specific to spherical terrain here).

The "upsamplerShader.glsl" is also more complex than in the previous
example. Indeed, it modulates the noise amplitude based on the local
terrain slope and curvature. For this, it first computes the slope
and the curvature, using "filters" defined in the slopexMatrix, 
slopeyMatrix and curvatureMatrix arrays. It then combines these
values to compute a noise amplitude factor in noiseAmp. The effect
of this additional code, producing non-uniform noise, can be seen
below (left: non-uniform noise, right: uniform noise).

\htmlonly

<img src="terrain2-a.png"> <img src="terrain2-b.png"><br/>
</center>
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html terrain2-a.png
\image html terrain2-b.png
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

\note you can replace line 141 in "upsampleShader.glsl" with 
"noiseAmp = 1.0;", while the program is running, to immediately
see the effect of this modulation factor based on the local slope
and curvature. You can also tune the constants in the original
expression to see their effect on the produced terrain.

Finally the "normalShader.glsl" is also more complex that in the 
previous example, because of the spherical deformation. In order
to compute a normal from 4 vertices it first finds the world
coordinates of these vertices after deformation (using the same
code as in the vertex shader of "terrainShader.glsl", and
described in \ref sec-spheredeform). It then computes the normal
in world space from these transformed points, and finally
outputs it value in tangent space.

\section sec-terrain3 Terrain3 example

\htmlonly
<img src="terrain3.png"><br/>
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html terrain3.png
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

This example extends the "terrain1" example in two ways: it adds an
ortho producer to get a fractal terrain texture, and it also improves
the user interface (use of proland::BasicViewHandler for a better
interactive navigation in the terrain, display of the logs and of the
framerate on screen, use of tweakbars).

\subsection sec-terrain3-tex Ortho producer

Compared to the "terrain1" example, the "helloworld.xml" file defines
a new tile cache for the terrain texture:

\dontinclude terrain3/helloworld.xml
\skip groundOrthoGpu
\until orthoProducer
\until noise="255

This cache can store up to 512 tiles of size 196x196 (including borders),
with RGB8 pixel format. It is used in the ortho producer defined just
after. This producer does not have an associated OrthoCPUProducer 
producing color residuals. It will therefore produce a fractal texture
based on the provided noise amplitudes and colors, specified in HSV
space (as opposed to RGB). The upsampling and add shader used by the
producer is not specified, so it is equal to its default value
"upsampleOrthoShader;". This shader is provided in the
"upsampleOrthoShader.glsl" file (the upsampling filter coefficients,
presented in \ref sec-ortho, can be found in the "masks" array).

\skip name="terrainNode"
\until /node

This ortho producer is used in a new tile sampler associated with the terrain,
itself associated with the "orthoSampler" GLSL uniform in the terrain
shader (see "terrainShader.glsl", which is almost the same as in the
"terrain1" example).

\note you can edit the noise color and amplitudes in the ortho
producer above, while the program is running, to immediately see
their effect on the produced terrain texture.

\subsection sec-terrain3-ui User interface

In this example the user interface is improved in several ways, compared
to the "terrain1" example. We first add three overlays: one to display
the framerate in the topleft corner of the window, another to display
the logs in the bottomleft corner (press F1 to show and hide these logs),
and a third one to display a tweakbar (click on the small box in the
bottomleft corner to maximize this bar).

For this we add three new nodes in the scene graph, with an "overlay" flag,
in the "helloworld.xml" file:

\dontinclude terrain3/helloworld.xml
\skip flags="overlay"
\until infoMethod
\until /node

Each node has a single draw method. These methods are defined by the 
following resources:

\dontinclude terrain3/helloworld.xml
\skip texture2D
\until drawTweakBar
\skip tweakScene
\until /tweakBarManager

Finally, in order to actually call the above methods, i.e., to
display these overlays, we extend the cameraMethod with a new
loop calling the "draw" method of all the scene nodes having
the "overlay" flag:

\dontinclude terrain3/helloworld.xml
\skip cameraMethod
\until /sequence

The second improvement in the user interface, compared to the 
"terrain1" example, is that we replace the basic mouse and keyboard
handling methods introduced in the "helloworld" example with more
"advanced" implementations, provided by the proland::BasicViewHandler
class (which is a subclass of ork::EventHandler - in addition to the
previous controls, it is also possible to move the camera with the
arrow keys).

For this we remove the "mouseX", "mouseY" and "rotate" fields in
"HelloWorld.cpp". Instead, we add a "view" field of type 
proland::BasicViewHandler, and a "ui" field of type ork::EventHandler.
We initialize these fields in the construtor: we create the view
handler manually, but we initialize the event handler by loading
the "ui" resource with Ork (it is defined above to be a 
proland::TweakBarManager, a subclass of ork::EventHandler that manages
the events related to the tweak bar). We finally link the two 
handlers with a call the "setNext" method: the effect of this is
that the events not processed by the tweak bar will be forwarded to the
view handler.

Most of the event handling work is now done by the "view" and "ui"
event handlers, chained together, so that we can simplify the
implementation of the "redisplay", "reshape", "idle", "mouseClick",
"mouseMotion", "mouseWheel", "keyTyped" and "specialKey" methods
to simply call the corresponding methods on "ui".

\section sec-terrain4 Terrain4 example

\htmlonly
<img src="terrain4.png"><br/>
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html terrain4.png
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

This example is based on the "terrain3" example, with two modifications:
first we replace the fractal terrain with a precomputed terrain, using
a proland::ResidualProducer,
second we modify the shaders and the terrain mesh to dynamically flip
the mesh diagonals, in order to reduce geometric aliasing.

\subsection sec-terrain4-res Residual producer

In order to define the residual producer, we first define a tile cache
"groundResiduals" on CPU:

\dontinclude terrain4/helloworld.xml
\skip groundResiduals
\until groundResiduals1

This tile cache can store up to 1024 tiles of size 197x197, with one
float per pixel. We can then define a residual producer using this cache,
which will load the residuals from the "DEM.dat" file. In this file the
residuals are stored in tiles of size 197x197 (thus we <i>must</i> use
this size for the tile cache), but only for tiles at level 3 or higher.
For the first levels the tile sizes are 29=24+5 at level 0, 
53=2*24+5 at level 1, and 101=4*24+5 at level 2. Since we want elevation
tiles of size 101, we specify via the "delta" attribute that the "root 
level" should start in fact at level 2.

\skip groundElevations
\until groundResiduals1

Once this residual producer is defined we use it in the definition of the
elevation producer. Here we removed the noise amplitudes that we used in
the "terrain3" example, but it is possible to keep them to add fractal
details to the precomputed terrain. And that's it, the above
changes are the only ones necessary to replace a fractal terrain with a
precomputed one (the "flip" attribute specifies that
we will use dynamic terrain mesh diagonals flipping - see below). 

\subsection sec-terrain4-flip Dynamic diagonal flipping

Compared to a basic rendering, as in the "terrain3" example, three changes
are needed to dynamically flip the terrain mesh diagonals to reduce
geometric aliasing:
<ul>
<li>the mesh used to render each terrain quad must not use the "triangles"
mode, but the "linesadjacency" mode. The goal is to have the four vertices
of each mesh quad available in a geometry shader, in order to decide which
diagonal to use for this quad, and then to emit the two corresponding 
triangles (see "quad.mesh").</li>
<li>the terrain shader must be extended with a geometry shader to transform
the "lines_adjacency" topology into "triangle_strip" (see "terrainShader.glsl").</li>
<li>the upsample and add shader used to produce elevation tiles must be changed
to correctly compute coarse elevations, taking into account that the coarse
mesh quad diagonal orientation depends on the elevation of the four quad
vertices (see "upsampleShader.glsl").</li>
</ul>

In "terrainShader.glsl" the main difference is the addition of the following
geometry shader:

\dontinclude terrain4/terrainShader.glsl
\skip _GEOMETRY_
\until #endif

Assuming that the four input vertices are the vertices of a mesh quad, in
counter clockwise order and starting from the bottomleft, this code checks
if the northwest-southeast diagonal would give a convex quad or not. If then
outputs two triangles using this diagonal if it is the case (a=0), or the
other one if it is not (a=5);

In "upsampleShader.glsl" the only difference, compared to the "terrain3" example,
is the computation of the coarse elevation. Instead of simply using the
average of the elevations of the vertices of the northwest-southeast diagonal 
(zc1+zc3)/2, we must now use either this average, or the average for the 
other diagonal, depending on which diagonal will be used for the coarse quad
(using the same criterion as above):

\dontinclude terrain4/upsampleShader.glsl
\skip all(equal
\until else
\until }

The example terrain has a regular, circular ridge designed to clearly show
the geometric aliasing problem (for real terrains this problem is much less
visible because the ridges are not so regular in general). You can see below
that the dynamic diagonal flipping (left) reduces the artifacts, compared
to fixed diagonals (right), but does not fully eliminate them.

\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

\note you can replace the "int a = ..." line above with "a = 0;", while the
program is running, to immediately see the effect of this algorithm on the
terrain.

\section sec-terrain5 Terrain5 example

\htmlonly
<img src="terrain5.png"><br/>
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html terrain5.png
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

This example is based on the "terrain3" example, with three modifications:
possibility to change the Sun position interactively, addition of a new
"terrain" with a specific mesh to render "clouds", and use of the
"tileMap" option in a tile sampler (see \ref sec-tilemap) to render the 
shadows of clouds on the terrain.

\subsection sec-terrain5-sun Dynamic Sun

In order to dynamically move the Sun, we first add a node for the Sun in the
scene graph:

\dontinclude terrain5/helloworld.xml
\skip node name="sun"
\until /node

We set its "position", which will in fact be interpreted as a direction, to
the zenith, i.e., (0,0,1). We also associate to this node, having the "light"
flag, a "draw" method. This method is defined as follows:

\dontinclude terrain5/helloworld.xml
\skip sunMethod
\until /sequence

In other words the "draw" method for the Sun simply sets the current position
of this node in the "worldSunDir" uniform of the "globalsShader" shader. This
shader is very simple, its goal is to hold the global variables needed by the
other shaders (here only the Sun direction):

\dontinclude terrain5/globalsShader.glsl
\skip uniform globals
\until return worldSunDir;
\until }

Now, in order to be able to access these global variables in the other shaders,
we need to link them together. For instance, we add a reference to the 
"globalsShader" in the "drawTerrainMethod" as follows:

\dontinclude terrain5/helloworld.xml
\skip drawTerrainMethod
\until /sequence 

Finally, we need to call the "draw" method for the Sun node before we render
the objects in the scene. For this we insert a new loop over the nodes having
the "light" flag in the camera method:

\dontinclude terrain5/helloworld.xml
\skip cameraMethod
\until /sequence

\note the proland::BasicViewHandler allows the Sun direction to be changed
interactively by dragging the mouse with the right button pressed. For
this it expects the scene graph to have a single node having the "light"
flag.

\subsection sec-terrain5-clouds Clouds

In order to render clouds we use a "terrain", placed above the real terrain,
rendered with a two-sided mesh to draw both the top and bottom of clouds,
and with some fragments discarded to make holes between clouds.

So we first define an elevation producer and a normal producer for the
clouds "terrain", like we would do for any terrain (the only difference
is the <tt>tileMap="true"</tt> option in the elevation tile cache,
but this is needed only to draw the clouds shadows - see below):

\dontinclude terrain5/helloworld.xml
\skip cloudElevations
\until normalProducer

We also define a terrain for the clouds:

\dontinclude terrain5/helloworld.xml
\skip terrainNode name="clouds"
\until terrainNode name="clouds"

Since we want to draw the clouds from below, and since we will also
want to draw their shadows on the ground (see below), which can come from
clouds outside the view frustum, we do not want here to perform frustum
culling while rendering the clouds "terrain". For this we define a new
version of the "drawTerrainMethod", with frustum culling disabled, and
called "drawCloudMethod" (note that we also include "globalsShader", to
be able to access the Sun direction in the cloud shader):

\dontinclude terrain5/helloworld.xml
\skip drawCloudMethod
\until /sequence

Finally we simply need to add a scene node for the clouds in the scene
graph, using the above resources:

\dontinclude terrain5/helloworld.xml
\skip cloudsNode
\until /node

Note that we translate the clouds "terrain" in z direction, to place it
above the real terrain. We also set the "storeInvisible" option to true,
to keep all the cloud tiles in cache, even those that are outside the
view frustum. The "cloud.mesh" is also different from the "quad.mesh"
used for the terrain: it contains two parallel 24x24 grids, one at z=0,
the other at z=1. The first grid is used to render the bottom of clouds,
while the second is used for the clouds top. This is done by the 
"cloudShader.glsl" shader, which is very similar to the "terrainShader.glsl"
of the "terrain3" example (the main differences are the "discard" in the
fragment shader, to make holes between clouds, and the use of the
"getWorldSunDir()" external function to replace the fixed Sun direction
previously used).

\subsection sec-terrain5-cloudshadow Clouds shadows

In order to render the shadows of clouds on the ground, the idea is to
compute the intersection of the light ray between the current point on
the terrain, and the bottom plane of clouds. Then, if there is a cloud
at this intersection point, the point on the terrain is in shadow
(this is only an approximation, because we neglect the 3D shape of the
top part of clouds). In order to implement this idea we need access
to the cloud tiles from the terrain shader. However, when rendering a
given terrain tile, we may need to access a different tile in the
cloud tile cache, when the Sun is not at zenith. This is what tile
maps are done for. The first step to use them is to add a tile
sampler for the cloud tile producer in the terrain node:

\dontinclude terrain5/helloworld.xml
\skip "terrainNode"
\until /node

Unlike the other tile samplers, the "clouds" sampler here has a
"terrains" attribute: this means that this sampler will be used to
access the tile maps of the specified terrains (here "clouds"). The
effect of this new tile sampler is that the tile maps for the
specified terrains will be updated at each frame, and that the uniforms
needed to access these maps will be also updated at each frame (here
in the "cloudsSampler" GLSL uniforms).

The second step is to use these uniforms, in the terrain shader, to
access the tile map and to perform the shadows computation. These
uniforms and the "textureQuadtree" function that uses them can be
found at the begining of the "terrainShader.glsl" file (they implement
the algorithm described in \ref sec-tilemap). This function is then
used in the fragment shader in a straightforward way (we simply
compute the intersection point "cp" and lookup the "cloudsSampler"
map at this point to find whether the current point "p" is in shadow
or not).

\section sec-preprocess Preprocess example

\htmlonly
<img src="preprocess.png"><br/>
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html preprocess.png
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

This example mixes several elements from the "terrain2", "terrain3" and
"edit2" examples, and illustrates how you can generate the files needed
by proland::ResidualProducer and proland::OrthoCPUProducer. More 
precisely, this example reuses the "HelloWorld.cpp" class and the user
interface resources of the "helloworld.xml" file of the "edit2" example.
It also reuses the "upsampleShader", "normalShader" and "terrainShader"
from the "terrain2" example (as well as the general structure of its
"helloworld.xml" file). Finally it reuses the "upsampleOrthoShader"
from the "terrain3" example.

The main changes are related to the preprocessing of the "srtm"
and "bluemarble" images, in "HelloWorld.cpp". The elevation image
"srtm" is preprocessed with the following call, in the "main" function:

\code
preprocessSphericalDem(new MyMap("srtm.png", 10000.0 / 255.0), 
    24, 192, 2, "data/dem", "tmpDem", 1.0);
\endcode

This indicates that the "srtm.png" file must be interpreted as a
spherial map, with elevations in meters encoded into bytes by 
using the scale 10000.0 / 255.0 (i.e. a 255.0 value means 10000.0 meters)
and that it must be preprocessed into the "data/dem" output folder,
using the "tmpDem" folder for temporary files, into tiles of size
between 24 (for the root, 29 with borders) and 192 (197 with borders),
up to quadtree level 2 (starting from the tiles of size 192, i.e.,
level 5 from the root). The last argument specifies that residuals
must be divided by 1.0 before beeing stored (into short values).

The terrain texture is preprocessed in a similar way:

\code
preprocessSphericalOrtho(new MyMap("bluemarble.png", 1.0), 
    192, 4, 2, "data/rgb", "tmpOrtho");
\endcode

This indicates that the "bluemarble.png" file must be interpreted as a
spherial map, with colors encoded into bytes with a scale 1.0 (i.e. 
a 255.0 value means 255) and that it must be preprocessed into the 
"data/rgb" output folder, using the "tmpOrtho" folder for temporary 
files, into tiles of size 192 (196 with borders), with 4 components
per pixel, up to quadtree level 2.

The "MyMap" class used above is also defined in "HelloWorld.cpp". 
It is a subclass of the proland::InputMap class, which can not be
instantiated because its getValue method is purely abstract. This
method must simply return the value of a pixel, which can be implemented
very easily for small maps (i.e. that fit in main memory):

\note the preprocessing can be interrupted at any time. Computations
will restart where they were stopped when you relaunch the preprocessing.
For very large maps, memory fragmentation sometime leads to "out of memory"
errors and thus the preprocessing stops. Then you can simply relaunch 
it to continue the computations (without recomputing the already generated
files). Once the precomputations are done, you can safely delete the
temporay folders.

\dontinclude preprocess/HelloWorld.cpp
\skip MyMap
\until };

Here the constructor simply loads an image into an array, and the
getValue method reads this array to return its result. For much
larger maps it is advised to override the getValues method, which
must return a whole region of the map at once (the size of this
region is specified in the last argument of the InputMap 
constructor - here 225. It must be a divisor of the width and 
height of the input map).

\section sec-exercise1 Exercise 1

\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly

\image html exercise1c.png
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

The goal of this exercise is to extend the "terrain3" example with
the sky and the ocean of the "ocean1" example. For this:
<ul>
<li>Create a new folder "exercise1": copy the files from the "terrain3"
example in this folder, as well as the "oceanShader.glsl" from the
"ocean1" example. Finally copy the "HelloWorld.cpp" file from the
"ocean1" example into your new directory (replace the one from the
"terrain3" example).</li>
<li>Copy the necessary resources from the "ocean1/helloworld.xml"
file into "exercise1/helloworld.xml": replace the "cameraMethod"
resource, copy all the resources from "drawOceanMethod" to "sunglare",
copy the "sun", "ocean" and "sky" scene nodes into the "scene" node
(put the "sky" node at the end). Finally replace the tweakScene
and tweakBarManager resources with all the resources from "viewHandler"
to "window" (from the "ocean1/helloword.xml" file).</li>
<li>Adapt the resource attributes for a flat terrain (the "ocean1"
example uses a spherical terrain, but we want a flat terrain as in
the "terrain3" example): remove the "radius" attribute in the "window"
resource, set the "radius" attribute to 0 in the draw ocean method,
set "z=6360000" in the "origin" uniform of the sky shader, and finally
set a better initial Sun position in the "translate" element of the
"sun" scene node (use 0,0,1).</li>  
</ul>

The result should look like the left image above. This is not very 
realistic, because the ocean is shaded with atmospheric effects, while
the terrain is not. To solve this problem:
<ul>
<li>Add the "globalsShader" and "atmosphereShader" modules in the
"setProgram" part of the drawTerrainMethod (in order to be able
to access the corresponding uniforms and functions in the terrain
shader).</li>
<li>Modify the "terrainShader.glsl" file: transform "p" in the vertex
shader into a variable sent to the fragment shader, add a #include
"atmosphereShader.glhl" in the fragment shader, and copy from the
"oceanShader.glsl" the getWorldCameraPos(), getWorldSunDir() and
hdr() function prototypes, as well as the whole sunRadianceAndSkyIrradiance
function (you will need them in the "main" function).</li>
<li>Copy from the "oceanShader.glsl" the WSD and WCP variables,
the call to the sunRadianceAndSkyIrradiance function, and the code
from "inscatter = ..." to "data.rgb = hdr(finalColor);"</li>
<li>Rename the variables to connect this new code to the existing
one correctly: replace earthP with p, N with n, oceanSunDir with
WSD, earthCamera with WCP, surfaceColor with data.rgb, and
finalColor with data.rgb.</li>
</ul>

The result should look like the middle image above. Note that this
is still not a "physically correct" lighting, because the terrin color,
before applying the atmospheric effects, is still computed with the
following ad-hoc model (which also uses a fixed Sun direction, yielding
a non black terrain at night!):
\code
float light = dot(n, normalize(vec3(1.0)));
data.rgb *= 0.5 + 0.75 * light;
\endcode
To improve this you need to replace these lines with the following
ones (the 0.1 factor is used to convert to data.rgb ad-hoc value to a 
physical albedo, which is typically in the range 0.1 - 0.2 for 
vegetation):
\code
float cosTheta = dot(n, WSD);
vec3 lightColor = (sunL * max(cosTheta, 0.0) + skyE) / 3.14159265;
data.rgb = 0.1 * data.rgb * lightColor;
\endcode

The result should now look like the right image above. Note that a
transition is visible when the camera goes below 20000 above the
ground, when the ocean suddenly appears. The solution to this
problem is to shade the ocean parts, in "terrainShader.glsl",
as done in the "oceanShader.glsl" (for this you need to copy the
code computing Lsun, Lsky, and Lsea and to rename the variables
appropriately. You will also need to replace sigmaSq with 
sigmaSqTotal. This code uses two uniforms that will need to be 
accessible in "terrainShader.glsl", namely "sigmaSqTotal" and "seaColor".
To solve this problem you will need to move them into "globalsShader").

\section sec-exercise2 Exercise 2

\htmlonly
<img src="exercise2.png">
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html exercise2.png
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

The goal of this exercise is to extend the "trees1" example in order
to interactively edit the tree density map. For this:
<ul>
<li>Create a new folder "exercise2": copy the files from the "trees1"
example in this folder, as well as the "initOrthoShader.glsl",
"brushOrthoShader.glsl", "composeOrthoShader.glsl" and 
"upsampleOrthoShader.glsl" files from the "edit2" example. Copy also
the corresponding resources from the "edit2/helloworld.xml" file
into the "exercise2/helloworld.xml" file.</li>
</ul>

As a first step, replace the LCC producer with an editOrthoProducer,
ignoring the LCC producer layers for the moment (recall that they
ensure that no trees can be generated on oceans or on cliffs). For
this:
<ul>
<li>remove or comment the "groundLccGpu" and "groundLccGpu1" 
resources in the "hellworld.xml" file.</li>
<li>copy the editOrthoCpuProducer and the editOrthoProducer
resources from the "edit2" example into this file (with the
corresponding tile caches).</li>
<li>rename the copied resources to "groundLccCpu", "groundLccCpu1",
"groundLccGpu" and "groundLccGpu1", set the tile sizes to 100,
the number of channels to 1, and the texture formats to R8 and 
RED.</li>
</ul>

At this stage the example should be working, but without any trees
and without any edition capabilities. This is normal since we used
an editOrthoCpuProducer without any precomputed texture, which 
therefore uses an empty one. Also we haven't added yet the user
interface components to enable texture editing. To solve this:
<ul>
<li>copy the "editOrtho" resource from the "edit2" example,
as well as the "ortho" editor element in the tweakBarManager 
resource.</li>
<li>copy the "pencil" and "pencilColor" uniforms from the 
"terrainShader.glsl" file in the "edit2" example, into the
"exercise2/terrainShader.glsl". Copy also the "data += pencilColor;"
line and the surrounding if statement. Finally convert
the "p" variable in the vertex shader to a variable sent to the
fragment shader.</li>
</ul>

The example should now be working again, and this time you should
be able to edit the LCC map interactively. Trees should then appear
where you painted on the terrain. There is however a problem,
namely that you can plant trees in oceans and cliffs. This is due
to the fact that we removed, for the moment, the "slopeFilter"
and "elevationFilter" layers from the LCC producer. The problem
is that we cannot add them back directly in our new editOrthoProducer,
because this kind of producer cannot have layers. The solution is
to use two producers:
<ul>
<li>rename the "groundLccGpu1" producer to "backgroundLccGpu1".</li>
<li>add a new orthoGpuProducer named "groundLccGpu1", and defined
as follows:
\code
<orthoGpuProducer name="groundLccGpu1" cache="groundLccGpu" maxLevel="7">
    <textureLayer name="background" producer="backgroundLccGpu1" 
        tileSamplerName="sourceSampler" renderProg="copyShader;" storeTiles="true"
        equation="ADD" destinationFunction="ZERO" sourceFunction="ONE"
        equationAlpha="ADD" destinationFunctionAlpha="ZERO" sourceFunctionAlpha="ONE"/>
    <textureLayer name="slopeFilter1" producer="groundNormals1"
        renderProg="slopeFilter;" tileSamplerName="fragmentNormalSampler"/>
    <textureLayer name="elevationFilter1" producer="groundElevations1"
        renderProg="elevationFilter;" tileSamplerName="elevationSampler"/>
</orthoGpuProducer>
\endcode
This producer does not use any associated CPU producer, and so starts
with empty tiles. The first layer copies the tiles produced by our
"backgroundLccGpu1" producer, by using the "copyShader" shader, in
which the "backgroundLccGpu1" tiles are accessible via the "sourceSampler"
uniform (the source code for this shader is given below). The two
other layers are the ones initially used in the LCC producer of the
"trees1" example.</li>
</ul>

The "copyShader.glsl" file must be defined as follows:

\code
#ifdef _VERTEX_
layout(location=0) in vec4 vertex;
out vec2 uv;

void main() {
    gl_Position = vec4(vertex.xy, 0.0, 1.0);
    uv = vertex.xy * 0.5 + vec2(0.5);
}
#endif

#ifdef _FRAGMENT_
#include "textureTile.glsl"

uniform samplerTile sourceSampler;

in vec2 uv;
layout(location=0) out vec4 data;

void main() {
    data = textureTile(sourceSampler, uv);
}
#endif
\endcode

The example should now be working as expected, i.e., even if you
paint on oceans or cliffs, the layers will set the density back to
0 in these areas, and thus no trees will appear in these areas.

\note the "storeTiles=true" attribute in the background layer specifies
that "backgroundLccGpu1" tiles must be locked in their cache as long as
the corresponding "groundLccGpu1" tiles are locked (by default this is
not the case: the "backgroundLccGpu1" are locked only during the 
<i>production</i> of the corresponding "groundLccGpu1" tiles, and can
then be evicted from the cache at any time). This is needed to
ensure proper edition of these tiles, because the editOrthoProducer requires
the tiles corresponding to the visible terrain quads to be present in cache
during edition.

\section sec-exercise3 Exercise 3

\htmlonly
<img src="exercise3.png">
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html exercise3.png
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

The goal of this exercise is to implement a user defined task, to draw
the bounding boxes of the terrain quads (see the above image). Starting
from the "terrain3" example, what we want to do is to extend the 
"drawTerrainMethod" resource with a new "drawTerrainBox" task, as 
follows:

\code
<sequence name="drawTerrainMethod">
    <setProgram>
        <module name="this.material"/>
    </setProgram>
    <drawTerrain name="this.terrain" mesh="this.grid" culling="true"/>
    <setProgram>
        <module name="boxShader"/>
    </setProgram>
    <drawTerrainBox name="this.terrain" mesh="box" culling="false"/>
</sequence>
\endcode

We want this task to use the current program (here the "boxShader"
shader set just before calling the task) to draw the mesh specified
in the "mesh" attribute for each terrain quad of the terrain specified
in the "name" attribute.

Before implementing this task, we can create the resources it needs,
namely the "boxShader" and the "box" mesh. The box shader resource 
can be declared like this:

\code
<module name="boxShader" version="330" source="boxShader.glsl"/>
\endcode

Its source code can be inspired from "terrainShader.glsl". We simply
need to replace, in the vertex shader, the code accessing the 
elevationSampler, and computing a continuous level of detail, with
a code computing the elevation based on a vec2 uniform containing
the minimum and maximum altitudes for the quad (this uniform will
need to be set by our drawTerrainBox task):

\code
uniform struct {
    vec4 offset;
    vec4 camera;
    vec2 blending;
    mat4 localToScreen;
} deformation;

uniform vec2 zminmax;

#ifdef _VERTEX_
layout(location=0) in vec3 vertex;

void main() {
    float h = mix(zminmax.x, zminmax.y, vertex.z);
    vec3 p = vec3(vertex.xy * deformation.offset.z + deformation.offset.xy, h);
    gl_Position = deformation.localToScreen * vec4(p, 1.0);
}
#endif
\endcode

The fragment shader is even simpler, we simply need to output a
constant color:

\code
#ifdef _FRAGMENT_
layout(location=0) out vec4 data;
void main() {
    data = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
}
#endif
\endcode

We also need a "box" mesh to be drawn with this shader. We can simply
use a wireframe cube, whose bounding box is [0,1]x[0,1]x[0,1]:

\code
0 1 0 1 0 1
lines
1
0 3 float false
24
0 0 0
1 0 0
1 0 0
1 1 0
1 1 0
0 1 0
0 1 0
0 0 0
0 0 1
1 0 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
1 1 1
0 1 1
0 1 1
0 0 1
0 0 0
0 0 1
1 0 0
1 0 1
1 1 0
1 1 1
0 1 0
0 1 1
0
\endcode

The "only" thing left is to implement the DrawTerrainBoxTask. 
For this, start from the source code of the proland::DrawTerrainTask.
You can keep exactly the same structure and methods, keep the "getTask"
method, remove the code linked to proland::TileSampler and to the "async"
mode (including the "findDrawableQuads" method). You can also remove,
in the "drawQuad" method, the "order" array, and simply draw the subquads
in a fixed order. The important parts to keep are the 
"t->deform->setUniforms" calls (which set the uniforms needed to project
vertices on screen, taking deformations into account). Finally you will
need a call like

\code
p->getUniform2f("zminmax")->set(vec2f(q->zmin, q->zmax));
\endcode

where "p" is SceneManager::getCurrentProgram() and "q" a terrain quad,
in order to set the "zminmax" uniform in the above "boxShader".

You also need to copy and adapt the DrawTerrainTaskResource class,
and the two static fields that follow, in order to be able to
instantiate your new task from Ork resources.

\section sec-exercise4 Exercise 4

\htmlonly
<img src="exercise4.png">
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html exercise4.png
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

The goal of this exercise is to implement a user defined layer, to draw
on each tile its location in the tile cache (see the above image). 
Starting from the "terrain3" example, what we want to do is to add a
layer to the ortho producer, which would draw on top of a "raw" tile,
its location in the cache. The first problem is that the ortho producer
is a proland::OrthoProducer, which does not accept layers (unlike the
proland::OrthoGPUProducer). The solution is two use two ortho producers,
as in "exercise2". For this (starting from the "terrain3" example):
<ul>
<li>rename the "groundOrthoGpu" and "groundOrthoGpu1" resources to
"backgroundOrthoGpu" and "backgroundOrthoGpu1".</li>
<li>add a new cache and a new producer, with one layer to copy
the tiles from "backgroundOrthoGpu1" (using the "copyShader" that you
can copy from "exercise2"), and the other, to be implemented,
to draw the location of the tile in its cache:
\code
<tileCache name="groundOrthoGpu" scheduler="defaultScheduler">
    <gpuTileStorage tileSize="196" nTiles="512"
        internalformat="RGB8" format="RGB" type="UNSIGNED_BYTE" min="LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR" mag="LINEAR"
        anisotropy="16"/>
</tileCache>
<orthoGpuProducer name="groundOrthoGpu1" cache="groundOrthoGpu">
    <textureLayer name="background" producer="backgroundOrthoGpu1" 
        tileSamplerName="sourceSampler" renderProg="copyShader;"
        equation="ADD" destinationFunction="ZERO" sourceFunction="ONE"
        equationAlpha="ADD" destinationFunctionAlpha="ZERO" sourceFunctionAlpha="ONE"/>
    <debugOrthoLayer name="debug" fontSize="24" font="basicFont" fontProgram="textShader;"/>
</orthoGpuProducer>
\endcode
</li>
</ul>

The "only" thing left is to implement the debugOrthoLayer. For this,
start from the source code of the proland::EmptyOrthoLayer. To draw
text on top of the produced tile, as in the overlays, look at the
source code of the ork::ShowInfoTask. You can also reuse this code
to adapt the EmptyOrthoLayerResource class. At the end the 
doCreateTile method of your layer class should look like this:

\code
ostringstream os;
os << dynamic_cast<GPUTileStorage::GPUSlot*>(data)->l;
ptr<FrameBuffer> fb = SceneManager::getCurrentFrameBuffer();
vec4f vp = fb->getViewport().cast<float>();
fb->setBlend(true, ADD, SRC_ALPHA, ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, ADD, ZERO, ONE);
fontMesh->clear();
font->addLine(vp, 2.0f, 2.0f, os.str(), fontHeight, 0xFF0000FF, fontMesh);
fontU->set(font->getImage());
fb->draw(fontProgram, *fontMesh);
fb->setBlend(false);
\endcode

where "os" contains the text to draw (the layer "l" of the "data"
slot in its GPUTileStorage).

\section sec-exercise5 Exercise 5

\htmlonly
<img src="exercise5.png">
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html exercise5.png
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

The goal of this exercise is to implement a user defined producer, to 
produce a terrain texture showing the contour lines of the terrain 
elevation (see the above image).

Note that, starting from the "terrain3" example, a very simple way
to show contour lines, without using any user defined producer, is
to insert the following line in the "terrainShader.glsl" file:

\code
data = mod(h, 10.0) < 1.0 ? vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0) : vec4(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0);
\endcode

between the "float h = ..." and "if (h < 0.1) ... " lines. It is
also possible to use a proland::TextureLayer to draw these contour
lines directly in the terrain texture tiles. For the purpose of
this exercise, however, we propose to implement this with a user
defined tile producer.

Starting from the "terrain3" example, we want to replace the
"groundOrthoGpu1" producer with a user defined producer:

\code
<contourProducer name="groundOrthoGpu1" cache="groundOrthoGpu" 
    elevations="groundElevations1" contourProg="contourShader;"/>
\endcode

meaning that this producer will use the "contourProg" shader to
transform the elevations produced by the "elevations" producer,
in order to generate colors corresponding to contour lines. It is
easy to declare the "contourShader":

\code
<module name="contourShader" version="330" source="contourShader.glsl"/>
\endcode

and its source code, "contourShader.glsl" is also quite simple (the
vertex shader computes uv coordinates, used in the fragment shader
to lookup the elevationSampler texture, from which a contour line
color is computed with the same code as above):

\code
uniform sampler2DArray elevationSampler;
uniform vec4 elevationOSL;

#ifdef _VERTEX_
layout(location = 0) in vec4 vertex;
out vec2 uv;
void main() {
    gl_Position = vertex;
    uv = (vertex.xy * 0.5 + 0.5) * elevationOSL.z + elevationOSL.xy;
}
#endif

#ifdef _FRAGMENT_
in vec2 uv;
layout(location = 0) out vec4 data;
void main() {
    vec4 zfc = textureLod(elevationSampler, vec3(uv, elevationOSL.w), 0.0);
    data = mod(zfc.z, 10.0) < 1.0 ? vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0) : vec4(0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0);
}
#endif
\endcode

The "only" thing left is to implement the "contourProducer". For this,
start from the source code of proland::NormalProducer (which is also
a producer using an external elevation producer, except that it uses
it to compute normals, while we want contour lines). You can keep
the elevationSamplerU and elevationOSLU uniforms, remove the
uniforms and code related to normalSamplerU and normalsOSLU (they
are used to compute coarse normals from the parent normal tile,
but we don't need this in our case), as well as the code related
to coordinate transformation (patchCorners, patchVerticals, etc).
You can also remove the begin and endCreateTile methods (in this
specific case they are only usefull when the producer has layers,
which is not the case here).
In the startCreateTile, doCreateTile and stopCreateTile methods, 
remove the code adding a dependency to the parent tile if level 
is > 0.

You must then add, in the doCreateTile method, the following line:

\code
getCache()->getStorage().cast<GPUTileStorage>()->notifyChange(gpuData);
\endcode

this notifies the tile storage that the content of a slot has changed,
and that mipmaps needs to be recomputed (this line is not present
in proland::NormalProducer, because this producer is not intended be
used with textures having mipmap levels).

You will also need to adapt the offset and scale used to compute 
the uv coordinates in "contourShader", and passed in the "elevationOSL"
uniform. Indeed the normal producer is designed to produce tiles
whose size is equal to the size of the elevation tiles (minus 
borders - e.g., for elevation tiles of size 101=97+4, the normal tiles
size is 97). Here, however, we want our producer to produce tiles whose size
is not related to the elevation tile size (in the "terrain3" examples,
the elevation tiles size is 101=97+4, while the ortho tiles size is 
196=192+4). It is quite easy to compute that the necessary scale
and offset values are given by the following code:

\code
int zTileWidth = elevationGpuData->getWidth();
float scale = ((zTileWidth - 5.0) / zTileWidth) * (tileWidth / (tileWidth - 4.0));
float offset = (1.0 - scale) / 2.0;
elevationOSLU->set(vec4f(offset, offset, scale, elevationGpuData->l));
\endcode

Indeed, we want the interior border of the texture tile, at uv
coordinates 2/B and (B-2)/B (where B is the texture tile size), to
match, after a transformation uv * scale + offset, the border of
the terrain grid, corresponding to the <i>centers</i> of the
elevation texture pixels at coordinates 2.5/A and (A-2.5)/A 
(where A is the elevation tile size):

<embed src="exercise5.svg" width="80%" type="image/svg+xml"/>
</center>
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html exercise5.svg
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

Solving the two equations 2/B*scale+offset=2.5/A and 
(B-2)/B*scale+offset=(A-2.5)/A gives the two values for
scale and offset shown in the above code.
