\section sec-ocean1 Ocean1 example

\htmlonly
<img src="ocean1.png"><br/>
\endhtmlonly

\htmlonly <!-- \endhtmlonly
\image html ocean1.png
\htmlonly --> \endhtmlonly

This example is based on the paper "Real-time Realistic Ocean Lighting
using Seamless Transitions from Geometry to BRDF", Eric Bruneton, Fabrice
Neyret and Nicolas Holzschuch, Eurographics 2010, and on the associated 
source code (basic version). It also uses the atmosphere model of the
"atmo" example, which must be run at least once before running this
example (in order to generate the precomputed atmospheric textures).

The "HelloWorld.cpp" is taken from the "Edit1" example. The ocean
shader and the proland::DrawOceanTask are based on the source code
provided with the above paper, with two improvements: support for
spherical oceans, and improved management of the horizon (see 
\ref sec-oceans).

In the scene graph description, the method to draw the ocean must be
declared like this:

\dontinclude ocean1/helloworld.xml
\skip drawOceanMethod
\until /sequence

This indicates that we want to use a spherical ocean (with a radius
of 6360005), which must be drawn when the altitude of the camera is
less than 20000. We must also specify the shader that contains the
uniforms related to ocean lighting.

The ocean scene node is then very simple:

\dontinclude ocean1/helloworld.xml
\skip name="ocean"
\until /node

The "HelloWorld.cpp" is taken from the "Edit1" example. The ocean

provided with the above paper, with two improvements: support for
spherical oceans, and improved management of the horizon (see 
\ref sec-oceans).

In the scene graph description, the method to draw the ocean must be
declared like this:

\dontinclude ocean2/helloworld.xml
\skip drawOceanFFTMethod
\until /sequence

This indicates that we want to use a spherical ocean (with a radius
of 6360005), which must be drawn when the altitude of the camera is
