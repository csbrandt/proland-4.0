<br/><h1>Proland Documentation - Ocean Plugin</h1>

The ocean plugin provides two tasks to draw an animated ocean. The
first one synthesizes the ocean surface with a sum of trochoids, while
the second one uses a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Both tasks can either
draw a flat ocean or a spherical one. Both tasks also provide to ocean
shaders the necessary data to compute ocean lighting as described in 
"Real-time Realistic Ocean Lighting using Seamless Transitions from 
Geometry to BRDF", Eric Bruneton and Fabrice Neyret, Eurographics 2010.
The "ocean1" and "ocean2" examples illustrate how these two tasks can
be used. <i>This plugin does not depend on any other plugin</i>.

At each frame, the proland::DrawOceanTask does the following:
<ul>
<li>update the uniforms in the associated ocean shader related to the
current camera position (i.e. matrices to transform between the "ocean frame"
described below, the world frame, the camera frame and the screen frame).</li>
<li>update the uniforms describing the horizon curve equation y=f(x) - 
see below.</li>
<li>update the uniform in the associated ocean shader related to the
current time.</li>
<li>update the grid used to draw the ocean in screen space, if the viewport
as changed since the last frame.</li>
<li>draw this grid with the ocean shader, which is then responsible for
most of the work (discarding triangles above the horizon, displacing the
remaining vertices based on the current time and waves data, and shading
the ocean fragments).
</ul>

The proland::DrawOceanFFTTask is very similar:
<ul>
<li>update the uniforms in the associated ocean shader related to the
current camera position (i.e. matrices to transform between the "ocean frame"
described below, the world frame, the camera frame and the screen frame).</li>
<li>update the uniforms describing the horizon curve equation y=f(x) - 
see below.</li>
<li>perform a FFT to update the textures representing the ocean's height.
This FFT is performed with shaders on GPU (the shaders for doing that
are provided in the "ocean2" example).</li>
<li>update the grid used to draw the ocean in screen space, if the viewport
as changed since the last frame.</li>
<li>draw this grid with the ocean shader, which is then responsible for
most of the work (discarding triangles above the horizon, displacing the
remaining vertices based on the current time and waves data, and shading
the ocean fragments).
</ul>

The "ocean frame" is a local reference frame in which all displacement 
and shading computations are done. The origin of this frame is the
vertical projection of the camera on the ocean's surface. Its z axis
is the vertical, and its xy plane corresponds to the ocean surface
at rest. For a spherical ocean, this xy plane corresponds to the
tangent plane to the sphere at the radial projection of the camera on
the sphere.

The ocean frame is thus a frame which is moving with the camera. Of 
course the ocean surface is not moving with the camera, so we cannot
directly use this frame to evaluate the ocean surface. Instead we
use a (dx,dy) offset, relatively to the origin of the ocean frame. That is,
to evalute the ocean surface at a point p=(x,y) in ocean frame, we
evaluate the ocean height function at (x-dx,y-dy). Initially this offset
is set to 0. It is then updated at each frame, to compensate for the
camera moves (see below). It is reset to 0 each time the camera goes
above the altitude at which the ocean is no longer displayed (we do
this to ensure that the offset is small, in order to avoid numerical
precision problem. Note that
we change the offset only when the ocean is not displayed, so no 
popping can be seen due to this sudden change).

The offset is updated at each frame as follows: if P(f) is the matrix
transforming world coordinates into ocean frame coordinates at frame
f, then the offset O(f)=(dx,dy) at frame f+1 is set to 
O(f+1)=O(f)+P(f+1)P<sup>-1</sup>(f)[0 0 0 1]<sup>T</sup>

The horizon is managed differently in Proland than in the source code
provided with the above paper: instead of computing at each
frame a grid covering only the ocean, the proland::DrawOceanTask
draws an immutable grid covering the whole screen. However, the vertex 
shader moves the vertices above the horizon curve on this curve, based
on the equation of this curve, whose coefficients are computed on CPU
and passed in the "horizon1" and "horizon2" uniforms.
